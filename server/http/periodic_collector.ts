// A tiny periodic-cache primitive shared by the app-aggregate /metrics collectors
// (business aggregates in server/http/business_metrics.ts, client-perf aggregates
// in server/http/client_perf_metrics.ts). Both follow the same contract: run one
// bounded aggregate query on a fixed interval, cache the result, and let the
// prom-client gauges publish the CACHED snapshot at scrape time. The DB is never
// touched per scrape, so a scrape storm can never turn into a query storm.
//
// This is deliberately NOT the game-state pattern (server/http/game_metrics.ts),
// where every gauge's collect() reads a cheap in-memory source live at scrape time.
// A Postgres aggregate is not a cheap live read, so these collectors sample on an
// interval instead and the gauges read the last sample.
//
// The refresh is fire-and-forget and self-guarded: a failed query keeps the last
// good snapshot (or the null start state) rather than throwing into the timer, so a
// transient DB blip never crashes the process or wedges the interval.
