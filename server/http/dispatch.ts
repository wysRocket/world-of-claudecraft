// The dispatcher-in-front for the API pipeline (Phase 9 of docs/api-pipeline/).
//
// It places the new in-house pipeline ahead of the legacy /api handleApi ladder
// via a per-path CATCH-ALL DELEGATE: for a path the registry OWNS (a matched
// RouteDef) it runs the Phase 5 onion under runOnion (the exactly-one-response
// wrapper); for ANY OTHER /api path it calls the injected legacy handleApi
// delegate UNCHANGED. The registry is EMPTY today (Phase 10 onward migrates the
// per-domain route tables), so every request delegates and behavior is
// byte-for-byte identical to today; the parity harness proves it.
//
// The returned dispatcher matches the legacy handleApi call shape (a
// fire-and-forget (req, res) => void): runOnion owns the single response, so the
// dispatcher never awaits-and-responds a second time. CORS and the OPTIONS-204
// preflight stay in main.ts's single top-level wrapper (applied before this
// runs and shared with the legacy ladder), so this onion intentionally does NOT
// mount withCors: keeping CORS in one place is what makes it identical on the
// delegated and the onion paths.
