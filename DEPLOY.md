One EC2 instance runs everything: the game server, Postgres, MediaWiki, and Caddy
(TLS reverse proxy). Sized for a small population, a `t4g.small`
(~$14/month all-in) is comfortable for a handful of concurrent players.

## 1. Confirm the repo is public

The standalone first-boot script clones
`https://github.com/levy-street/world-of-claudecraft.git` anonymously. If you
are deploying a private fork instead, use a deploy key or another secret
manager-specific flow; do not paste long-lived personal access tokens into EC2
user data.

## 2. Launch the instance

In the EC2 console:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| AMI | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (**arm64**) |
| Instance type | `t4g.small` (2 vCPU Graviton, 2 GB) |
| Storage | 20 GB gp3 |
| Security group | Inbound: **22** (your IP only), **80**, **443**, nothing else |
| User data | Paste `deploy/user-data.sh` with `DOMAIN` filled in |

Leave `DOMAIN=""` if you want to test by IP first over plain HTTP,
you can set the domain later (step 4).

Allocate an **Elastic IP** and associate it with the instance so the
address survives restarts.

The game server and Postgres bind to loopback only (`127.0.0.1:8787` /
`127.0.0.1:5433`); Caddy is the sole public entrance, so the security
group above is the whole exposure story.

First boot takes a few minutes (Docker image build). Watch it with:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<elastic-ip> sudo tail -f /var/log/eastbrook-setup.log
```

## 3. Point DNS at it

Create an **A record** for your domain (e.g. `play.example.com`) pointing
at the Elastic IP. In Route 53: Hosted zone, Create record, type A,
the Elastic IP.

## 4. Turn on TLS (if you started without a domain)

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<elastic-ip>
echo 'play.example.com {
	@ops path /livez /readyz /metrics
	respond @ops 404
	route /wiki* {
		reverse_proxy localhost:8080
	}
	reverse_proxy localhost:8787
	encode gzip
}' | sudo tee /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

Caddy fetches and renews the Let's Encrypt certificate automatically;
WebSockets are proxied with no extra config, and the client auto-selects
`wss://` on https pages. Open `https://play.example.com` and you're live.

## Updating the game

Run these in order. If you bundle the private bot detector, its pull and the
type-check gate are not optional. The detector is an optional component in a second
checkout (`private/bot_detector`), and the build never complains about it: a missing
clone silently falls back to the no-op stub, and a clone that has drifted out of step
with the game tree compiles into the image and only fails when the server calls it.
The type check is what catches that mismatch, and it has to run before the image is
built, not after it ships.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<elastic-ip>
cd /opt/eastbrook

# 1. The game code.
sudo git pull

# 2. The private bot detector, if you bundle it. The image bundles whatever sits in
#    private/bot_detector at build time (see the bot detector note below), so this
#    clone has to move with the game tree. Pull it in the same breath as the game
#    repo, every time. Skip this step entirely if you run the open-source stub.
sudo git -C private/bot_detector pull
#    First time on this host, clone it instead: it is not part of the public checkout.
#    sudo git clone <private-bot-detector-repo> private/bot_detector

# 3. The type-check drift gate: this is what catches a detector that no longer
#    matches the interface the server calls. A deploy host runs Docker but often no
#    Node, and a production checkout has no devDependencies, so run it in the same
#    Node the image builds with. The checkout goes in read-only and is copied inside
#    the container, so no root-owned node_modules is left behind on the host. Two
#    hardenings: the find sweep drops every .env and every .git from the copy (the
#    host .env holds every production secret, and a nested clone's .env or .git
#    config can carry tokens; the type check needs none of them), and
#    --ignore-scripts stops dependency install hooks from running as root with
#    network access. The memory bound matters because this runs on the live box
#    BEFORE the game stops: an unbounded npm ci plus tsc can spike past what the
#    host has spare and create the exact memory pressure the game service's
#    mem_limit exists to prevent. 2g is ample for this tree's npm ci and tsc; the
#    swap bound matches so the gate cannot push the host into swap either.
sudo docker run --rm --memory 2g --memory-swap 2g -v /opt/eastbrook:/src:ro -w /app node:22-alpine \
  sh -c 'cp -a /src/. /app && find /app \( -name .git -o -name .env \) -prune -exec rm -rf {} + && npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund && npx tsc --noEmit'
#    Red means STOP, do not deploy: the image would build fine and fail at runtime.
#    One exception: exit code 137 means the container hit the 2g memory bound (a
#    gate-environment failure, not a type error); raise the bound or run the gate
#    off-box, do not skip it.
#    (On a host that does have Node 22 on PATH, `npm ci --ignore-scripts && npx tsc
#    --noEmit` in the checkout runs the same type check, but WITHOUT the container's
#    memory bound; on the live box prefer the containerized form above.)

# 4. Optional: warn the players. POST /internal/restart-countdown broadcasts an
#    in-game countdown. The secret header is the ONLY gate: nothing restricts the
#    endpoint to loopback (the edge hides /livez /readyz /metrics but not
#    /internal/*), so treat RESTART_COUNTDOWN_SECRET as a real production secret.
#    With the secret unset the endpoint answers 404 and there is nothing to warn
#    with. The countdown runs 10 minutes; wait for it to elapse before step 5.
curl -fsS -X POST -H "x-woc-deploy-secret: <RESTART_COUNTDOWN_SECRET>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8787/internal/restart-countdown

# 5. Stop the game and let it drain. The container's stop grace period covers the
#    whole shutdown chain (character saves included), and /livez deliberately stays
#    200 while draining, so neither Docker's healthcheck nor the watchdog can read a
#    graceful drain as a wedge.
sudo docker compose stop game
#    On an older checkout whose compose file has no stop_grace_period, pass the
#    window explicitly: sudo docker compose stop -t 60 game

# 6. Rebuild and start. (`sudo docker compose build game` before step 4 shortens the
#    outage: the image is then ready the moment the countdown ends.)
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

Then verify, before you walk away:

```bash
# the realm answers
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/status

# Docker calls the game container healthy, not `starting` and not `unhealthy`
sudo docker compose ps
sudo docker inspect -f '{{.State.Health.Status}}' eastbrook-game

# the startup logs are free of errors, and the bot detector line names the
# implementation you actually expect (`stub (no-op)` or `private`); repeated
# TypeErrors that mention the detector mean the bundled clone is out of step
# with the game tree: stop, pull it (step 2), and rebuild
sudo docker compose logs game --since 10m
```

A container that never leaves `starting`, or that flips to `unhealthy`, is telling
you the world loop is not completing passes: roll back rather than leaving it up.

Players online during the restart are disconnected for a few seconds and
can log straight back in; the server saves all characters on shutdown.

## Outbound email (AWS SES)

The server sends account-lifecycle mail (signup, password reset, email change,
security notices; see `server/email/`). Without configuration it uses the
console transport: emails are logged, never sent. To deliver for real via SES:

1. In SES (same region as the instance is simplest), create a **domain
   identity** for the sending domain and publish the DKIM CNAMEs, MAIL FROM,
   and DMARC records it gives you.
2. Request **production access** for the SES account (until granted, the
   sandbox only delivers to individually verified addresses).
3. Attach an IAM role to the instance allowing `ses:SendEmail` on that
   identity (preferred over access keys; the SDK default chain picks it up
   through the instance metadata service).
4. In `/opt/eastbrook/.env` set:

```bash
EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses
EMAIL_SES_REGION=us-east-1
EMAIL_FROM="World of ClaudeCraft <noreply@worldofclaudecraft.com>"
EMAIL_BASE_URL=https://worldofclaudecraft.com
```

Then `docker compose up -d game`. The startup log line
`email transport selected` confirms which transport is live; every send
attempt is audited in the `email_log` table. A provider with a plain HTTP
API works too: set `EMAIL_API_URL`, `EMAIL_API_KEY`, and `EMAIL_FROM`
instead (see `.env.example`).

## Backups

A nightly `pg_dump` runs at 03:15 UTC via `/etc/cron.d/eastbrook-backup`,
writing gzipped dumps to `/var/backups/eastbrook/` and keeping 14 days.

Restore (stack must be up):

```bash
gunzip -c /var/backups/eastbrook/eastbrook-2026-06-10.sql.gz \
  | sudo docker exec -i eastbrook-db psql -U eastbrook eastbrook
```

For off-box safety, sync the directory to S3 occasionally:
`aws s3 sync /var/backups/eastbrook s3://your-bucket/eastbrook/`.

## Operational notes

- **Secrets**: the Postgres password is generated at first boot into
  `/opt/eastbrook/.env` (mode 600, gitignored). Nothing else to manage.
- **Timed Daily Rewards ban rollback**: releases with timed bans retain expired rows in
  `daily_reward_bans` and exclude them with an `expires_at` predicate. Before rolling
  back to a release that predates timed bans, stop every game process and remove expired
  rows with `DELETE FROM daily_reward_bans WHERE expires_at <= now();`. The older release
  cannot honor future expiry times. Operators must either remove still-active timed bans
  before rollback or explicitly accept that they will become permanent until manually
  unbanned. Do not alter the nullable `expires_at` column during rollback.
- **Bank ledger audit**: `node scripts/bank_audit.mjs` (reads `DATABASE_URL` from the
  environment) replays the append-only `bank_ledger` against live character bank state
  and exits non-zero on any discrepancy. Run it after an economy incident or a restore.
- **Username bans**: set `USERNAME_BANLIST_FILE=/opt/eastbrook/username-banlist.txt`
  to load blocked username terms from a private newline- or comma-separated
  file. `USERNAME_BANLIST` can also provide a comma-separated inline list.
- **Chat filter**: the word lists are now **managed live from the admin
  dashboard** (Chat Filter tab), stored in the database and seeded with sensible
  defaults on first boot. Two tiers: *soft* words are masked client-side with
  `****` (players can toggle the filter off in Options), and *hard* words (slurs)
  are blocked server-side and escalate from a warning to account-wide timed mutes
  (durations editable in the same tab). `CHAT_CENSOR_LIST` / `CHAT_CENSOR_FILE`
  are still read **once**, on the first boot of a fresh database, to seed the soft
  list; after that they are ignored and the dashboard is authoritative.
- **Realms (horizontal scaling)**: each server process serves one realm,
  set by `REALM_NAME` (default `Claudemoon`). To add a realm, run another
  process against the **same** `DATABASE_URL` with a different `REALM_NAME`
  and `PORT` (e.g. behind its own vhost or compose service). Characters,
  friends, guilds, presence, and the World Market are realm-scoped, so the
  worlds are fully isolated: players on different realms can't see, whisper,
  friend, guild, or share an auction house with each other. Concurrent boots
  serialize their schema setup behind a
  Postgres advisory lock, so starting several at once is safe. Character and
  guild names remain globally unique across realms.
- **Raid reset time zone**: raid lockouts end at the next 3 AM (03:00, the classic daily
  reset) in the realm's civil time zone. Set `REALM_RESET_TZ` to an IANA zone per
  realm process (e.g. `America/New_York`, `Europe/Paris`); it defaults to
  `America/New_York`. The process must run on a full-ICU Node (the default for
  modern Node); an unresolvable zone falls back to the default, and if even the
  default cannot be resolved the process fails fast at boot.
- **Bot gate (Cloudflare Turnstile)**: login and registration can be gated by
  Turnstile so headless clients (the aiohttp/websockets bot wave) can't create or
  sign into accounts. It is **off until configured**: both halves must be set or
  the gate silently does nothing:
  - `TURNSTILE_SECRET` (server runtime, secret): enables server-side verification.
  - `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` (public): renders the widget. This is read by the
    **client and inlined at `npm run build` time**, so it must be present when the
    image/bundle is built, not just at runtime. Use a separate Turnstile widget per
    environment (dev vs prod). If the origin's nginx (in the `ansible-scripts` repo)
    sets a Content-Security-Policy, it must allow `script-src`/`frame-src
    https://challenges.cloudflare.com` or the widget won't load.
- **Wallet connection and linking**: injected Wallet Standard extensions and the
  direct Phantom/Solflare iOS and Android web handoffs work without configuration.
  To offer desktop website QR codes and handoff to Backpack, Jupiter, and other
  external apps, create a Reown project at
  `https://cloud.reown.com`, allow the production/staging/local website origins,
  and set the public `VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` while building the client. Connecting
  authorizes the current browser session to ask the wallet app for signatures;
  linking is the separate one-time signature that saves the public address to a
  WoC account. The website Electron distribution instead opens the same deployed
  origin in the normal browser, where an installed wallet extension authorizes a
  short-lived link or purchase operation before returning through the app's custom
  URL. This browser handoff needs no additional environment variable. The app never
  receives a recovery phrase or private key. Wallet UI is enabled on website
  desktop/mobile and the website Electron distribution,
  and disabled on Capacitor iOS/Android and Steam. Reown AppKit 1.8 uses a
  community license with commercial-use thresholds, so confirm the current terms
  before production deployment. $WOC balance reads remain server-side only: set
  `SOLANA_RPC_URL` to a production Solana RPC endpoint and leave it unprefixed so
  API keys are not bundled into the client. `WOC_MINT` defaults to the canonical
  token mint and should only be overridden if that mint changes. Set
  `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` in single-realm production so shared player-card pages emit
  stable absolute Open Graph URLs.
- **Steam link + achievement mirror**: players can link a Steam account so
  their Book of Deeds achievements mirror to Steam (`server/steam/`). It is
  **off until configured**: with `STEAM_ENABLED` unset, every `/api/steam`
  route answers `steam.disabled`, the mirror is inert, and no client renders
  link UI. To enable, set `STEAM_ENABLED=1` plus the Steamworks `STEAM_APP_ID`
  and a publisher Web API key in `STEAM_WEB_API_KEY` (partner.steam-api.com)
  in the server runtime env. Docker Compose passes these three variables from
  the host `.env` into the game container. The key is a secret: it must never
  appear in logs or client code. Linking is a cosmetic mirror for deed
  achievements only; login with Steam does not exist.
- **Season 1 Armory promo card (welcome screen)**: **off until configured**: the
  welcome screen shows the Season 1 Armory store promo card only when
  `ARMORY_PROMO_ENABLED=1` is set in the game server runtime env. The flag is
  read by `server/welcome.ts` (behind a short in-process cache) and served to
  signed-in clients via `GET /api/welcome/flags`; the client-side half of the
  gate lives in `src/ui/store_promo_card.ts`.
- **Claudium economy service**: `WOC_ECONOMY_SERVICE_URL` is resolved by the
  game server. Use `http://127.0.0.1:8798/v1/claudium/` only when both services
  run directly on the host. For the Compose game container with a host-run
  economy service, use `http://host.docker.internal:8798/v1/claudium/`.
  A separately deployed economy service should use its internal or remote DNS
  URL instead.
- **Never** set `ALLOW_DEV_COMMANDS=1` in production: it enables the full
  `/dev` cheat set (the level/teleport cheats the test bots use, plus item
  grants, mob spawns, instance teleports, and the dev command GUI).
- **Bot detector (implementation)**: the open-source tree ships with a no-op stub
  (`server/bot_detector/stub.ts`). Detection hooks are wired in, but they observe
  nothing and never act. To bundle the real behavioral detector, clone the private
  `bot_detector` repo into `private/bot_detector` **before** `npm run build` (or
  `npm run build:server`). The Docker build copies `private/` into the build stage,
  so the same rule applies to deploys that run `docker compose build`: the private
  checkout must exist before the image is built. That directory is not part of the
  public checkout. At build time, confirm which implementation was picked:
  `[build:server] bot detector: stub (no-op)` vs `... bot detector: private`.
- **Anti-bot runtime knobs**: `MAX_WS_PER_IP_HARD` (default `20`) caps simultaneous
  WebSocket connections per source IP; extra connections are refused at the
  handshake. `ANTIBOT_ENFORCE=1` lets the detector act on its findings (e.g. kick);
  when unset, detection is observe-only. With the no-op stub, enforcement has no
  effect regardless of this flag.
- **Metrics endpoint**: `GET /metrics` (Prometheus exposition) is **off until
  configured**: it answers 404 unless `METRICS_TOKEN` is set in the server
  runtime env. When set, the scraper must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  (anything else gets an opaque 401). Configure the token on **both** the server
  and the Prometheus scrape job in the same change or scraping goes dark, and point
  the scrape job at `127.0.0.1:8787/metrics` on the host: the public edge answers
  404 for all three ops paths (`/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`) once the Caddy
  block below is in place. `/livez` and `/readyz` need no token, but they are for
  the container healthcheck and the host watchdog, which read them locally and
  never through Caddy; nothing on the public internet needs them.
- **Game watchdog (wedge recovery)**: `deploy/game_watchdog.sh`, installed as
  `/usr/local/bin/eastbrook-watchdog` and fired every minute from
  `/etc/cron.d/eastbrook-watchdog`. Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` only acts when
  the container process EXITS, so a wedged-but-alive container (world loop stalled,
  port still held) sits there until a human ssh-es in. The compose healthcheck probes
  `GET /livez`, which answers **503 once the world loop has not completed a pass in
  over 30 seconds** (unauthenticated on the server port, and hidden at the public
  edge: see the Caddy note below); Docker turns that
  into a container health status; the watchdog reads that status and restarts the
  container **only** on `unhealthy`. Never on `starting`, never on `healthy`, and
  never when the container is stopped or its image predates the healthcheck. It never
  touches a **draining** container, and cannot: a drain deliberately holds `/livez` at
  200 so a graceful shutdown is never misread as a wedge, so a draining container
  never reports unhealthy. A five-minute cooldown (stamped in
  `/var/lib/eastbrook/watchdog-last-restart`) sits above the roughly two-minute floor
  before the healthcheck can re-evaluate a restart, so the watchdog never fires blind; a
  container that keeps re-wedging is restarted about once every five minutes (Docker's
  own `restart: unless-stopped` cannot help, since a wedge never exits the process), and
  an `flock` serializes overlapping cron fires. End to end, a wedge takes roughly 90
  seconds to flip `unhealthy`, up to a minute more before the next once-a-minute cron
  fire reads it, then up to the stop grace period to shut down, then a boot: budget
  about four minutes from stall to recovered when planning on-call. Dry-run
  it any time, it changes nothing:
  `sudo /usr/local/bin/eastbrook-watchdog --dry-run --verbose`. Actions land in
  `/var/log/eastbrook-watchdog.log`; it is silent when there is nothing to do.
  **Installing it on a host that is already running**: `deploy/user-data.sh` runs at
  EC2 **first boot only** and never runs again, so any host provisioned before the
  watchdog existed (or provisioned some other way) has to be given it by hand:

  ```bash
  cd /opt/eastbrook && sudo git pull
  sudo install -m 755 deploy/game_watchdog.sh /usr/local/bin/eastbrook-watchdog
  sudo install -d -m 755 /var/lib/eastbrook
  echo '* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/eastbrook-watchdog >> /var/log/eastbrook-watchdog.log 2>&1' \
    | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/eastbrook-watchdog
  sudo /usr/local/bin/eastbrook-watchdog --dry-run --verbose  # confirm it sees the container
  ```

  The watchdog only has something to read once the game container runs an image
  whose compose file carries the healthcheck, so install it alongside that deploy,
  not before it.
  **The Caddy ops block needs the same by-hand treatment**: `deploy/user-data.sh`
  writes the 404 block for `/livez`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` at first boot only, so
  a host provisioned before it existed still proxies all three to the public
  internet, and `/livez` can now answer 503, which tells anyone polling it exactly
  when the world loop is down. Add the matcher pair inside EACH public site block of
  `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` (alongside the existing `reverse_proxy`; `respond` runs
  before `reverse_proxy`, so nothing else in the block needs to move):

  ```
  @ops path /livez /readyz /metrics
  respond @ops 404
  ```

  Then validate and reload, and confirm from outside:

  ```bash
  sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
  sudo systemctl reload caddy
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<your-domain>/livez  # expect 404
  ```

  The healthcheck and the watchdog are unaffected: both read the container's own
  port and never traverse Caddy.
- **API dispatch (rollback)**: every REST surface (`/api`, `/admin/api`, `/oauth`,
  `/internal`) runs through the in-house request pipeline by default. To roll back to
  the old handler ladder, set `API_DISPATCH=legacy` in the server runtime env and
  restart the process: it is one flag, no code redeploy. Leaving it unset (or `new`)
  keeps the new pipeline. The boot log warns with an `ALERT` line only when the legacy
  ladder is serving in production, which after this default flip means the warn fires
  exactly when someone has rolled back (`API_DISPATCH=legacy`), a deliberate choice
  worth noticing rather than a routine boot.
- **Env hygiene: no empty numeric placeholders.** A SET-BUT-EMPTY numeric env
  line (`CHAT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=`, `PORT=`, `MAX_WS_PER_IP_HARD=`,
  `PERF_REPORT_RETENTION_DAYS=`) now means the DEFAULT, not `0`. Before the
  validated config loader, `CHAT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=` resolved to `0` (keep chat
  logs forever); the same line now resolves to the 90-day default and pruning
  turns ON. Audit deployed env files for empty placeholder lines: delete the
  line to take the default, or set an explicit value (`CHAT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=0`
  is still keep-forever). Two more rows follow the same "empty means the DEFAULT"
  contract:
  - `NODE_OPTIONS=` (empty) means node's own defaults, which node sizes from TOTAL
    system memory rather than the container's `mem_limit`, so on a host larger than the
    limit node can grow past it and be OOM-killed mid-tick. Set a heap cap under the
    limit on any host with the memory to back it, for example
    `--max-old-space-size=4096` under the 5g `mem_limit` in `docker-compose.yml`: size
    the two together and a runaway heap kills node inside the container, which Docker
    restarts, rather than sending the kernel OOM-killer hunting for a victim on the
    host. Raising the heap cap above the container limit trades one failure for a worse
    one. Set this explicitly in the production `.env` (it is empty by default so a small
    dev host is not handed a heap cap it cannot back).
  - `MAX_PLAYERS_PER_REALM=` (empty) means the built-in default of 5000. A positive
    value is the number of sessions a realm admits before it refuses fresh WebSocket
    joins (`/api/status` advertises the value, so the realm list can show Full
    honestly); an explicit `0` disables the cap entirely. The default is a guard rail,
    not a capacity estimate: what a realm can actually carry depends on the host, so
    measure yours and set the number you measured.
- Logs: `sudo docker compose -f /opt/eastbrook/docker-compose.yml logs -f game`.
- If the instance ever feels tight, stop, change instance type,
  start. Everything lives in Docker plus one EBS volume, so nothing
  else changes.

## Deploying an SFX Studio export

Follow the full local authoring and pre-export checklist in the
[SFX Studio tutorial](docs/sfx-studio-tutorial.md).

Deploy the game code containing the runtime SFX pack loader once, including a
store or OTA rollout for native clients. After that, audio-only Studio exports
for the same compiled catalog do not require another web or native client build.
Native clients fetch compatible packs from their configured production origin;
if that request fails, they keep using the SFX bundled with the app.

1. In SFX Studio, publish each finished audio master and apply the playback mix.
2. Click Export All and extract the downloaded ZIP on the production host.
3. Ensure the persistent overlay belongs to the deploy user, then run the
   installer from the extracted artifact:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/eastbrook/sfx-runtime
   sudo chown "$USER":"$(id -gn)" /opt/eastbrook/sfx-runtime
   sh install.sh /opt/eastbrook/sfx-runtime
   ```

4. Keep the overlay persistent and set `SFX_PACK_DIR` to its `audio/sfx`
   directory. Docker Compose does this with `EASTBROOK_SFX_DIR`, which defaults
   to `./sfx-runtime` beside the compose file.

The POSIX installer needs only `/bin/sh` and either `sha256sum` or `shasum`; the
bootstrap installs `unzip` for extracting the artifact. A Node-based
`install.mjs` alternative is included too. The installer verifies every
content-addressed MP3, installs immutable blobs first, and atomically replaces
`runtime-pack.json` last. It does not delete old
blobs, because already-open clients and rollback may still reference them. An
artifact with a different compiled catalog hash, a missing fixed key, or an
unsupported extra key is rejected by the client and needs a normal game
deployment instead. Compatible constrained mob-subfamily keys may be added by
an artifact.

## Automatic production CPU incident capture

`npm run ops:cpu-monitor` watches Docker CPU and attaches to the game only after a
confirmed trigger. By default it polls every 30 seconds, confirms that two of three
samples exceed 90%, and then records a 20-second V8 CPU profile at a 4 ms sampling
interval. The profile is temporary and event-triggered, so the profiler has no
steady-state game-loop cost.

Run the monitor as a supervised service on an always-on private operations host,
not in the game container. The Levy Street deployment should manage that service
in the private Ansible repo, where SSH aliases and credentials already live. A
representative direct invocation from that host is:

```bash
npm run ops:cpu-monitor -- \
  --direct \
  --host world-of-claudecraft-prod \
  --container eastbrook-game \
  --out-dir /var/lib/woc-prod-cpu-monitor
```

The service unit should use `Restart=always`, `RestartSec=10`, `UMask=0077`, an
unprivileged local user, and the repository checkout as its working directory. With
systemd, use `StateDirectory=woc-prod-cpu-monitor` and
`StateDirectoryMode=0700`; the monitor safely initializes an empty, private,
service-owned directory on first use. The remote SSH principal needs narrowly
controlled access to the Docker operations used by the script and to `flock` for
capture serialization. General `sudo docker` access is effectively root access.
Use a dedicated principal plus a root-owned forced-command or validation wrapper
that admits only the exact expected commands for the named container; do not grant
a wildcard Docker sudo rule to an ordinary account. The PID and profiler clients
are immutable, root-owned helpers copied into `/app/ops` by the production image,
and their `docker exec` calls do not consume client-supplied stdin. The wrapper must
validate the complete `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`, reject unexpected stdin, and allow
only those fixed helper paths. Checking only a `docker exec` command prefix still
permits arbitrary code execution in the production container and is not sufficient.

The monitor verifies private file ownership and permissions, uses local and remote
exclusive locks, and retains at most 24 validated captures or 30 days of captures.
Captures and process logs can contain sensitive operational data, so the artifact
directory must stay private and must not be served over HTTP.

Each incident directory includes `cpu.cpuprofile`, game and perf logs,
container/process snapshots, Docker stats before/during/after, metadata, and SHA-256
checksums. Open `cpu.cpuprofile` with the Load profile action in the Chrome DevTools
Performance panel. Review `metadata.json` first: `complete` should be true and
`profileStartDelayMs` records the delay until the profiler acknowledged it had
started. A fully complete directory also contains a `COMPLETE` marker written after
the metadata and checksum manifest. A valid CPU profile is retained even if
supporting context is degraded. The `errors` array explains any missing auxiliary
artifact without triggering a second profile every two minutes.

Detailed tick-profiler JSON is optional. It requires an existing staff bearer that
can access the `ops.perf` admin routes, supplied through a service-owned mode-0600
file with `--ops-token-file`. The current role model does not provide a dedicated
machine-only bearer, so do not copy a broad personal admin session into the service.
Provision a narrowly scoped service credential in the server before enabling this
option. When enabled, `tickCapture` in `metadata.json` must be `complete`.
The tick result also records loop callback count, sim tick count, catch-up callback
count, and maximum ticks per callback so callback aggregation is visible during a
saturation event.

Before enabling the service, verify its SSH user has only the required passwordless
Docker commands and run one controlled check:

```bash
npm run ops:cpu-monitor -- --once --dry-run --direct \
  --host world-of-claudecraft-prod \
  --container eastbrook-game \
  --out-dir /var/lib/woc-prod-cpu-monitor
```

Once automatic tick capture is working, remove `PERF_TICK_LOG=1` from production.
The admin-triggered profiler enables detailed sim sub-phase timing only during its
wall-clock capture window; leaving the environment flag enabled would keep that
extra instrumentation active on every tick.

## Admin dashboard

The admin dashboard (account/character/session metrics, live players,
server health) is served by the same game server process:

- **Production**: point `admin.worldofclaudecraft.com` at the instance
  (A record) and add a server block for it in the nginx config in the
  internal `ansible-scripts` repo, proxying to the same game port as the
  main site. The Node server serves the dashboard for any hostname
  starting with `admin.`.
- **Standalone/Caddy**: set `ADMIN_DOMAIN` in `deploy/user-data.sh`
  (or add the extra site block to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` by hand).
- **Local dev**: open `http://localhost:8787/admin` (or `/admin` under
  `npm run dev`).

Access requires signing in with a game account that has the `is_admin`
flag. The hostname only selects which HTML shell is served; every
`/admin/api/*` call is checked against the account flag.

Grant the first admin:

```bash
# locally
npm run admin:grant -- <username>

# on the box (the runtime image only ships bundled code, so use psql)
sudo docker exec eastbrook-db psql -U eastbrook eastbrook \
  -c "UPDATE accounts SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE username = '<username>';"
```

Revoke with `npm run admin:grant -- <username> --revoke` (or set the
flag to `FALSE` in SQL).
