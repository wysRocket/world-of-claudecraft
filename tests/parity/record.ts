// Parity recorder: drives a Scenario and produces a committed-golden Trace.
//
// The Recorder installs the default-off Rng observer (src/sim/rng.ts) for the
// duration of a recording, accumulates the per-tick SimEvent stream and the rng
// draw-order fingerprint, and samples full player + tracked-entity state on a
// fixed cadence. Everything it captures is deterministic: same seed + same drive
// script => identical Trace (the gate asserts this by recording twice).
//
// Draw-order policy: we observe the SHARED `sim.rng` (mulberry32) only. Each draw
// folds its 32-bit mulberry output into a rolling FNV-1a digest in draw order, so
// the digest pins both the draw COUNT and the draw ORDER across the ~109 shared
// draw sites. We deliberately do NOT tag draws with a callsite (a stack-derived
// tag churns on every sim.ts edit, which is exactly what the refactor does); the
// (count + ordered value) fingerprint catches reordering without that churn.
// Construction-time draws happen before the observer can exist (the Rng is born
// inside the Sim ctor), so they are pinned by the frame-0 state sample instead.
