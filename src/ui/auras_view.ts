// Pure derivation of the aura strip (the #buff-bar player buffs/debuffs and the
// #tf-debuffs target debuffs).
//
// This is the per-frame HOT core: hud.update() rendered each entity's auras every
// frame. The old renderAuras used an ad-hoc `__sig` cache + an innerHTML wipe; this
// core replaces the derivation half, and auras_painter.ts replaces the DOM half with
// a typed keyed per-aura node pool (Top risk 3: the pool's tooltip closure reads a
// LIVE mutable slot, never a captured aura).
//
// DECISION 9 (component contract): the core is INSTANCE-PARAMETERIZED by the aura
// MODE ('all' for the buff bar, 'debuffs' for the target frame). createAurasView(mode,
// deps) preallocates a per-aura slot pool ONCE and returns a tick(entity) that mutates
// it IN PLACE and returns the SAME { slots, count } container every call, so a correct
// frame allocates no new array/object garbage (the reused-reference allocation proxy,
// tests/util/alloc_probe.ts). Two modes yield two independent views (the buff bar and
// the target debuffs are two instances, not a code fork).
//
// The DEBUFF allowlist lives HERE (it is presentation/domain classification, lifted
// out of the old painter-side branch). The core stays DOM-free and i18n-MECHANISM-free
// (no i18n runtime import): the localized aura name + the formatted stack count are
// produced by INJECTED deps each frame (so the i18n keys keep firing and the painter
// never concats), while the icon identity and the duration text are pure.
//
// DECISION 15 (parity): the input is a structural subset of IWorld's Entity.auras that
// BOTH the offline Sim and the online ClientWorld mirror expose. Aura.stacks is
// OPTIONAL (the wire sends it only when > 1), so the core treats a missing stacks the
// same as 1 (no stacks badge), and a Sim-shaped aura {stacks:1} and a ClientWorld
// mirror aura {stacks:undefined} derive identical output.

// per aura. A negative-value stat aura (a mob's attack-power sap, an intellect-draining
