// per-mob-per-frame) picks which nearby mobs attempt an idle bark, damped by
// how many same-family mobs are clustered together so a pack does not all
// bark in the same sweep. MOB_IDLE_BASE_CHANCE started at 0.35 (generous, on
// the theory that the mastered idle takes are quiet even boosted) and was
// tuned down by ear in-game to 0.17, which felt right around both the wolf
// camps and the ogre war-camp.
