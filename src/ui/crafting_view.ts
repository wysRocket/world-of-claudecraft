// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the crafting window (issue #1127).
//
// This is the pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-consumer split (root
// CLAUDE.md Conventions; reference unit_portrait.ts / vendor_view.ts). It owns
// the one thing the crafting window decides that is worth testing without a
// DOM: for each known recipe, whether the local player currently holds every
// required reagent (so the "Craft" button can be enabled/disabled), and the
// display quantities for each reagent line. The DOM/i18n side lives in a
// thin painter; rendering is driven entirely off the structure returned here.
//
// DOM-free and i18n-free so tests/crafting_view.test.ts can drive it directly.
