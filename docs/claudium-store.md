# WOC Store and Claudium packs

The WOC Store reads cosmetic availability, Claudium costs, balances, and purchase results from
the economy service. The game client does not invent catalog entries or prices.

## Recommended USD packs

The previous ladder extended to USD 5,000 and USD 10,000. Those packs are not appropriate for a
consumer game store. The recommended replacement follows the familiar premium-currency range
used by established game storefronts while keeping the one Claudium equals USD 0.01 display peg.

| Pack key | USD price | Claudium credited | Bonus over peg |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `claudium_500` | $4.99 | 500 | 1 |
| `claudium_1050` | $9.99 | 1,050 | 51 |
| `claudium_2200` | $19.99 | 2,200 | 201 |
| `claudium_4000` | $34.99 | 4,000 | 501 |
| `claudium_6000` | $49.99 | 6,000 | 1,001 |
| `claudium_13000` | $99.99 | 13,000 | 3,001 |

The economy service should expose only these six SKU rows. Remove the old high-value rows rather
than hiding them in the client.

## Stripe configuration

Create one Stripe Price for each USD pack and configure the corresponding economy-service
variables. Suggested names are:

```text
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_500
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_1050
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_2200
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_4000
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_6000
STRIPE_PRICE_CLAUDIUM_13000
```

These names match the economy service implementation. Do not place Stripe secret keys or Price
IDs in the game-client repository.

SOL, USDC, and WOC amounts must continue to be quoted by the economy service from the USD value.
The WOC rail should return the existing service-computed 20 percent discount. The game client
displays the returned quote and does not calculate token prices or discounts. All three native
rails flow through the same native quote, confirm, and purchase endpoints proxied by the game
server (`server/claudium_proxy.ts`); the economy service decides which rails are offered via its
native rails response (`rails.sol`, `rails.usdc`, `rails.woc`), so enabling or disabling USDC is
an economy-service deployment change, not a game-repository change.

## Weapon cosmetic identifiers

The game mechanical registry is `src/sim/content/weapon_skins.ts`. It owns IDs, models, rarity,
and stable collection IDs, but no player copy or price. English names, looks, and lore live in
`src/ui/i18n.catalog/armory.ts`. The companion economy-service deployment catalog is
`catalogs/claudium_catalog.season1.json`; it is the sole authority for availability and Claudium
cost. A storefront product is purchasable only when the same `itemId` exists in both files and the
service returns a valid positive cost. A missing service row remains visible as unavailable and
the game does not synthesize a fallback price. Every weapon cosmetic row in the service catalog
must use `kind: "skin"`; legacy `kind: "item"` rows are not Season 1 Armory products and are
filtered out by the game client.

The current companion service catalog publishes these tier prices for the game registry's products:

| Collection | Claudium cost | Service `itemId` values |
|---|---:|---|
| Guildmark | 200 | `guildmark_arming_sword`, `brasscap_axe`, `tempered_flanged_mace`, `guildmark_dirk`, `brasscrown_staff`, `lacquered_wand`, `fletcher_s_guild_bow` |
| Emberwrought | 1,000 | `cinderbrand_sword`, `emberbite_axe`, `smoulderfall_mace`, `ashspark_dagger`, `forgeheart_staff`, `emberwrought_wand`, `cinderlatch_crossbow` |
| Hoarfrost | 3,000 | `ice_fang_sword`, `glaciersplit_axe`, `rimecrusher_mace`, `frostbite_dagger`, `hoarfrost_vigil_staff`, `everwinter_wand`, `winterbite` |
| Fallen Star | 5,000 | `solheim_sword`, `skyrender_axe`, `starfall_mace`, `astravyr_dagger`, `cosmarch_staff`, `emberwish_wand`, `encore_bow`, `meteorlatch_crossbow` |

Do not copy the retired placeholder `purple_*`, `redskull_*`, or `emberfang_sword` rows into the
weapon storefront. Keep product IDs in lockstep across both registries. Update Claudium costs only
in the companion service catalog. The initial category is `weapons`. Future `outfits` or `mounts`
require an explicit game registry, allowlist, and UI update plus matching service rows; adding a
service-only row does not make a new category purchasable.
