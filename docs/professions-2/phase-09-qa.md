# Phase 09 QA: Verify Station presence and recipe training

Independent audit of Phase 9: stations visible in both hosts, training live and
server-authoritative, and no existing character lost a recipe.

As-landed notes for this QA (2026-07-19, authoritative over older wording; details in
state.md's Phase 9 entry): the taught set is exactly the three COMBO_RECIPES; commons and
the 75/150 recipes stay grandfathered-known to everyone (so "learn a recipe" beats run on a
combo at the forge or apothecary). There is NO sim_i18n matcher row for train denials by
design: trainResult is a text-free structured event rendered via hudChrome.training.* (the
station_required precedent); verify the keys, do not hunt for a matcher. The grandfather
normalize is flag-discriminated (recipesGrandfathered): new characters have the flag true
from creation and must train combos; the legacy fixture is a state blob WITHOUT the flag.
The parity goldens were regenerated (own commit) purely for the new persisted flag. Mobile
stations never satisfy training proximity (pinned). The crafting window filters to known
recipes; the train_not_taught_here arm is content-unreachable until a drop/quest
acquisition recipe exists (precedence pinned instead).

## Phase-specific QA emphasis

- Train command replay/idempotency: a duplicated or replayed wire command must never
  double-charge the fee or double-grant a recipe; prove it with a test, not by reading the code.
- Grandfather normalize on a legacy save fixture: load a real pre-phase state blob and prove
  every previously craftable recipe id reads as known after normalize, and that a second
  normalize pass changes nothing.
- GLB budget unchanged if no new GLB landed; if one did land, verify the media manifest regen,
  `registerPreload`, and `npm run asset:budget` all hold.
- The teach-tier gate and the visible ladder (the 2026-07-17 amendment): a below-tier train
  attempt denies with the localized tier reason; the Train view SHOWS the locked row with
  its named requirement (never hidden); crossing the threshold flips it to teachable; the
  hobby craft uses the same thresholds; common recipes never lock; and a KNOWN recipe is
  never use-gated regardless of skill (drive a real craft to prove the no-admission-gate
  rule survived the new predicate).

## QA Starter Prompt

```
This is Phase 09 QA of the Professions 2.0 feature: verify Station presence and recipe
training.
Model: Opus 4.8, xhigh effort. Harness: Claude Code.
Goal: audit the Phase 9 diff for correctness, missing tests, dead code, determinism,
three-host parity, and i18n completeness for THIS phase; fix what the audit finds; return a
verdict.

STEP 0 - PRE-FLIGHT:
- Run git status. The tree must be clean (a concurrent session may share this checkout);
  stop and report if it is not.
- Scan Claude Code memory (the MEMORY.md index) for: node25-breaks-jsdom-gate (run the gate
  under Node 24), the PR 2039 state (the professions foundation surfaces), and the
  design-language program (today's tokens only; no DESIGN.md phase vocabulary).

STEP 1 - LOAD CONTEXT (do NOT read planning docs directly):
Spawn one Explore agent to read and summarize:
- docs/professions-2/state.md and docs/professions-2/progress.md
- docs/professions-2/phase-09-station-training.md (deliverables, acceptance criteria,
  validation commands, invariants, and the phase-specific QA emphasis bullets)
- The Phase 9 diff: git diff against the phase-start commit recorded in progress.md's Phase 9
  entry (if absent, the commit before the first Phase 9 commit); the stat plus the full diff
  of every touched file.
The summary must return: every deliverable and acceptance criterion, the exact validation
commands, the touched files grouped by domain (render, ui, sim, world_api, net, server,
tests), and the emphasis bullets.

STEP 2 - QA AUDIT:
Spawn three parallel agents, each given ONLY the Explore summary. Prompt every agent for
COVERAGE, not filtering: report every correctness or requirement gap with confidence and
severity; filtering happens in a later pass.
- Correctness agent: verify every deliverable and acceptance criterion against the real code;
  run the phase's validation commands (the ui/render and net/wire matrix rows plus
  npx vitest run tests/minimap_markers.test.ts tests/snapshots.test.ts
  tests/world_api_parity.test.ts and the new train and grandfather tests); exercise the real
  behavior, not just the tests (walk to a station, confirm the minimap marker, open the Train
  view, learn a recipe in BOTH the offline Sim and the online ClientWorld; drive the denial
  paths: out of range, insufficient gold, not teachable here, already known). Probe the
  emphasis items explicitly: train replay/idempotency (no double-charge, no double-grant),
  the grandfather normalize on a legacy save fixture, and the GLB budget unchanged if no new
  GLB landed.
- Test coverage agent: find untested paths (every denial branch, the exactly-affordable fee
  edge, the marker variant against both host shapes, normalize idempotency on a second load);
  ADD the missing tests, including a determinism test if sim logic changed in this phase;
  remove orphaned tests the phase left behind.
- Dead code and cleanup agent: unused imports and types, sim purity (no DOM/Three or
  render/ui/game/net imports in src/sim/; all randomness through Rng; no Math.random,
  Date.now, or performance.now), leftover TODOs and debug logging, stray placeholder props
  not driven by the STATIONS registry, and hex literals outside tokens.css/theme.ts.
- Also spawn review agents per the Review Dispatch Matrix in
  docs/professions-2/implementation-plan.md; check git diff --name-only and spawn ONLY
  matching rows. Run the qa-checklist agent over the complete phase diff.
- If any agent response comes back truncated, re-spawn that agent to resume from its last
  completed item; never treat partial output as a full report.

STEP 3 - FIX:
- Apply every BLOCKING and SHOULD-FIX finding, test-first where a bug reproduces (reproduce
  with a failing test, then the smallest change that turns it green).
- Rerun the validation commands from STEP 2 until green.
- Commit with explicit paths (never git add -A), Conventional Commits with a scope and a body
  (fix(professions), fix(ui), test(professions) as they fit).

STEP 4 - UPDATE DOCS + MEMORY:
- Update docs/professions-2/progress.md (the Phase 9 QA result and findings summary) and
  docs/professions-2/state.md if any surface changed during fixes.
- Record durable surprises (fixture traps, wire quirks, flaky suites) to Claude Code memory.

STEP 5 - FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Verdict: PASS, PASS-WITH-FOLLOWUPS, or FAIL.
- Counts: findings by severity, fixed versus deferred, tests added and removed.
- Deferrals with reasons and owners.
- A one-line handoff for Phase 10: recipe ladders may rely on live training and the
  trained-not-known default.

STOPPING RULES:
- Stop and report FAIL if grandfathering cannot be proven on the legacy fixture; that was the
  phase's gate, do not paper over it.
- Stop if a fix would require violating a locked decision in state.md; defer it with a written
  reason instead.
