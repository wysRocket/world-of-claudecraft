## Per-phase deliverable checklists

Each phase file (`phase-NN-*.md`) carries the authoritative acceptance
criteria; mirror the checkboxes here as phases complete.

### Phase 1: Ring and identity foundations
- [x] `CRAFT_RING` adopts the blueprint ring order (design-doc order); geometry tests re-pinned
- [x] `ArchetypeState` carries per-archetype attunement history (JSONB additive, back-compat load)
- [x] Combo eligibility requires the matching attunement in the shared rule, both hosts
- [x] Pair-named archetype title keys land (Smith, Outfitter, Apothecary, Bombardier + the six future pairs)
- [x] PR 2039 should-fix items resolved; ring adoption landed on the PR 2039 head pre-merge

Phase 1 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the packet's
three audit roles plus the full review dispatch matrix (architecture,
frontend seam, cross-platform sync, privacy/security, migration safety,
pin quality, qa-checklist). The save-compat stopping rule was evaluated
and NOT triggered (v0.26.0 shipped the acceptance quests retired, the
ClientWorld archetype methods as no-op stubs, and no UI caller, so no
player-held save carries old-ring pair ids; an executed round-trip fixture
confirmed drop-by-design plus stable canonical ids). QA landed: coverage
additions for the pair helpers, transition state machine, resolved-count
credit, and a same-seed determinism pin; the one loosened hobby re-pin
restored to exact literals; the nythraxis interact-credit site routed
through questObjectiveRequired; a minimal accuracy pass over the
guide.professions wiki prose (full rewrite stays Phase 15). Deferred, with
notes in state.md: the hobby-switch XP repeatable (maintainer balance
decision), the COMBO_RECIPES record field order (cosmetic), legacy
IWorldProfessions member retirement (Phase 15 candidate).

### Phase 2: Masterwork model
- [x] Craft outputs deterministic; five-way quality roll retired; `trivialAt` retired
- [x] Masterwork proc (skill, self-signed, specialization inputs) with pinned rng-draw contract
- [x] Masterwork stats baked via `item_budget` into `instance.rolled.stats`; deeds reader still coherent
- [x] Masterwork SimEvent with celebration payload; power-ceiling tuning targets in `state.md`

Phase 2 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the packet's
three audit roles plus the matched dispatch-matrix rows (architecture,
cross-platform sync, privacy/security, migration safety, pin quality,
qa-checklist; frontend seam and database performance were NO-MATCH for
this diff). The phase-emphasis probes all bind: an inserted extra rng
draw reddens five tests across three suites, a 2-tier bump reddens the
raid-floor bound through its literal tripwire pins (the derived sweep
moves with the model by design; the literal rows are the teeth, never
delete them thinking the sweep suffices), and the legacy rolled.quality
path is proven end to end in both hosts. QA landed: proc-chance wiring
pins through the real craft path (self-signed at hunted seed 69, the
joint specialization-plus-tier 74/75/76 boundary at hunted seed 2,
spares recorded in-file), the ClientWorld craftResult mirror's
masterwork flag, the top-level enchant marker save/load round trip, an
observed-roll pin making the miss-arm's seed-1 premise load-bearing,
an inv-snapshot passthrough pin (masterwork and legacy instance
payloads reach the client byte-identical), and the quality-roll
retirement cleanup (dead clampMaterialRarity deleted with its orphan
test pin; the area CLAUDE.md re-taught the deterministic model). One
audit finding dissolved on verification: the reported vestments armor
anomaly is the displaced starter recruit_tunic (delta 30 minus 20),
not a bug. Deferred with reasons: the 0.15-cap integration hunted pin
(the clamp is pure-function pinned and every term wiring is craft-path
pinned; a fourth hunted seed adds maintenance without coverage), and
the online-inspect equippedInstances gap (pre-existing, recorded in
the state.md drift notes for the Phase 6 surfacing decision).
Mixed-fleet safety verified: the previous release's HUD event if-chain
ignores unknown SimEvent types, so a new server's masterwork event is
harmless to an old client.

Phase 3 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the
packet's three audit roles plus the matched dispatch-matrix rows
(architecture, cross-platform sync, pin quality, qa-checklist;
privacy/security, migration safety, frontend seam, and database
performance were NO-MATCH for the QA diff). One real correctness
defect found and fixed test-first, in the pre-landed PR 2045 trade
code rather than the phase diff: tradeConfirm ran the a-to-b transfer
to completion before removing b's give, so same-itemId bidirectional
trades cross-contaminated (a swapped instance bounced straight back
to its owner; a plain-for-instance offer spared the instance and
mis-routed a plain copy). The swap is now two-phase (removeOffer both
sides, then grantOffer both sides), matching the model fitsAfterSwap
already validated; conservation held in all variants, so no dupe or
loss ever occurred. QA landed: the two sequencing repro pins (revert
experiment confirms both red on the old code and only they guard the
reorder), a partial-stack sparing pin (removePreferFungible must
choose), a no-escrow cancel contract pin, the live GameServer
broadcast suite for hcb (claim-after-first-sight arrives as a lite
dyn-only record, pinned by hcb-present plus no-nm; interest-scope
eviction and re-entry deliver claims AND clears made out of view, and
a delta-guarded mirror mutation reds the clear arm), and the
claimed-corpse arms of corpseLootAvailability (self-claimed viewer,
claimed-by-another, claimed-with-personal-loot stays openable). Docs:
the hcb as-landed deviation swept into the phase file and QA twin
(the amend-the-twin trap), the phantom bandwidth hcb pin claim
corrected (the snapshots sparse-absence assertion is the no-bloat
tooth), the bareClient drift note rescoped to the real 21-copy
repo-wide idiom (extraction filed as #2088, a standalone chore), and
the Phase 4 despawn-grace heads-up recorded. Deferred with reasons: a
bandwidth claimed-corpse scenario (docs now truthful instead; the
sparse-absence pin covers the regression that matters) and a
distinct-itemId slot-order byte-equivalence pin (the push-to-end plus
splice-compaction reasoning is airtight per the architecture review).
- [x] Trade carries `ItemInstancePayload` end to end (regression test)
- [x] `harvestClaimedBy` mirrored online; corpse picker stops offering claimed corpses
- [x] Crafting view consumes the shared combo-eligibility rule in both hosts

Completed 2026-07-17. The trade code fix had pre-landed on release via
PR 2045; this phase added the missing bidirectional full-payload pin
(signer, charges, rolled including the masterwork marker, enchant,
boundTo, both directions in one mixed trade). harvestClaimedBy rides
the per-entity wire as the sparse hcb key (server/game.ts dynamicFields
emit, unconditional ClientWorld reset in src/net/online.ts), pinned by
the round-trip suite in tests/snapshots.test.ts and the online-picker
parity suite in tests/corpse_harvest_sim.test.ts; hcb is deliberately
NOT in ALL_DELTA_KEYS / TERSE_TO_IWORLD (those pin selfWireJson maybe()
self keys; the per-entity round-trip pins are the teeth, with the
snapshots sparse-absence assertion as the no-bloat pin; bandwidth stays
green but has no hcb-specific scenario).
Combo-gating liveness pinned in
tests/crafting_view_combo_liveness.test.ts (Sim and ClientWorld arms
fed by a real cprof broadcast; decisiveness mutation-tested). Review
fan-out (cross-platform-sync, privacy-security, qa-checklist,
test-coverage-auditor): PASS, zero blocking. Deferred to Phase 4:
src/main.ts still passes harvestStateReliable = (online === null) at
the three interaction open-gate sites, so the truthful mirror is not
yet consumed at the online OPEN gate (harvest-only corpses still do
not open online, pre-existing); flip with an open-gate test when
Phase 4 makes gathering trust corpse claims (details in state.md).

### Phase 4: Node materials and pristine veins
- [x] Per-rarity node material tables replace placeholder junk (zone-1 stays low-tier)
- [x] Rare+ node yields signed like corpse yields
- [x] Per-node-type rare events: pristine vein / ancient heartwood / moonlit bloom (spawns, per-flavor soft broadcasts, deed-mark hooks)
- [x] `gatherResult` consumed: gather cue + rarity-colored loot line

Completed 2026-07-18 (phase-start HEAD 4d8b32d09, the release/v0.28.0 tip
with Phase 3 QA aboard). `NODE_MATERIAL_TABLE` in
`src/sim/professions/gathering.ts` grants zone-tiered materials (four new
low-tier defs; zones 2 and 3 reuse the existing recipe-consumed premium
reagents, closing the loop the TOOL_RECIPE_STUBS note forward-declared);
zone 1 grants only the sellValue-4 starters per the stockpiling
mitigation, pinned with a non-vacuous negative arm. resolveHarvest draws
twice (rarity, then the 1/90 rare-event roll in the new
`gather_events.ts` module); the one-draw pins were re-pinned deliberately.
Rare events are five-fold always-signed yields with a per-recipient
soft-zone broadcast (the Phase 6 reuse mechanism; instance space excluded
via DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD) and dormant `gather_event:<flavor>` deed marks.
The Phase 3 deferral landed: main.ts's three open-gate sites now trust
the hcb mirror (`tests/gather_open_gate.test.ts` pins both arms plus the
pre-existing INTERACT_RANGE + 1 open boundary, which keeps despawn-grace
corpses out of reach). The HUD consumes gatherResult as a rarity-colored
"You gather:" line worded apart from the grant hub's "You receive:" loot
line with no second cue (review catch: the first draft double-logged and
double-played; five-reviewer fan-out, zero blocking after fixes). A new
parity scenario `professions_gather` (seed 3) pins the draw order across
hosts; no existing golden changed. gatherResult gained qty and rareEvent
fields; the cue reuses existing sampled SFX (new cues are
manifest-gated). Deferred: node tier gating (Phase 12), recipe
consumption of the new materials (Phase 10), rare-event deed authoring
(Phase 15), a live-server instance-exclusion broadcast arm (unit-level
covered).

Phase 4 QA (2026-07-18): PASS with fixes. Three packet audits plus the
four matched dispatch-matrix rows (architecture, cross-platform sync,
frontend seam, qa-checklist; privacy/security, migration safety, and
database performance were NO-MATCH), all seven reports complete first
try with the hard tool-call budgets baked in. REAL FIND, fixed
test-first: the signed harvest grant could overflow bag capacity by one
slot per rare-or-better roll (the fungible canAddItem pre-gate passes
on stack top-up room while a signed instance needs a fresh slot;
runtime-confirmed via the crossing case of a slot-full bag holding a
partial stack of the zone material). Every signed unit now requires a
genuinely free slot, with an unsigned stack top-up fallback when none
exists, so the truncation contract wins over signing in that edge; the
draw order and the professions_gather golden are byte-identical. The
corpse focus-harvest path carries the same pre-existing hole (it was
the cited precedent) and is filed as #2139, deliberately not fixed
here because it sits outside the phase diff. QA also landed: the
crossing-case pin, the finder-only achievement-cue pin plus
quality-color source pins (the unpinned halves of the D1 contract and
acceptance criterion 5), and comment corrections (the gatherLine
catalog comment described the exact loot-family wording the divergence
pin forbids; the gathering.ts header still claimed no world nodes
exist; gatherRareEvent's spare fields named as Phase 15 forward
payload; corpseLootAvailability's harvestStateReliable documented as a
deliberately retained seam whose false arm stays pinned POSITIONALLY
in tests/corpse_loot_availability.test.ts and tests/interactions.test.ts,
which a name-only grep misses, an audit claim that dissolved exactly
there). Verified dismissals: finderName cannot smuggle the [[i:
item-link token (validCharNameShape forbids brackets), and all four
phase-emphasis probes bind. Deferred with reasons: the rare-event
windfall's per-instance loot-line/cue burst (consistent with the D1
cue-ownership decision, Phase 15 polish candidate), the zone-1 signed
starter instances design confirm (maintainer, see state.md), the
gatherEvent.* top-level catalog namespace (functional, moving it now
is overlay churn without user value), and the pre-existing unused
instanceOrigin import in tests/parity/scenarios.ts.

### Phase 5: The professions wheel window
- [x] New window at deeds quality per DESIGN.md: view core (UI_PURE_CORES), painter, styles, i18n
- [x] Ring visualization, per-craft skill bars, tier pips, title/majors/hobby, live perks
- [x] Identity-view semantics preserved (role, ceiling, nudges, tutorial); next-unlock and switch-cost lines
- [x] Progressive disclosure: simplified unattuned / pre-first-tier state
- [x] Desktop + mobile responsive; screenshots captured for the PR
- [x] Launchers (minimap or window row + keybind) consistent with existing windows

Completed 2026-07-18 (phase-start HEAD c1b6c68f2, the release/v0.28.0 tip
with Phase 4 QA aboard). Pure UI on post-2039 reads: no wire data, no sim
behavior, no IWorld member. `src/ui/professions_view.ts` (UI_PURE_CORES)
COMPOSES `profession_identity_view` rather than absorbing it (recorded
decision: the crafting window and quest dialog keep consuming the card,
and Phase 6 owns the crafting window), so role, ceiling, both nudges, and
the tutorial state survive by construction; it adds the ring layout math
(wrap-safe pair arc, hobby chord), bars and pips with core-derived fill,
the perks readout from `PERK_THRESHOLDS`, the next-unlock union, the
switch-cost line via `requiredAmendsProgress`, progressive disclosure,
and the refresh signature. `src/ui/professions_window.ts` is a
deeds-pattern cold painter; the ring renders as DOM nodes over one inline
SVG styled entirely from `components.css` tokens (recorded decision over
canvas: theme and language switches restyle with no token caching).
Launchers: minimap micro-button, More-tray entry, and Shift+KeyP (bare
KeyP is the spellbook). Icons: fourteen procedural recipes plus
`professionIconUrl` over an empty committed WebP override set, the
`assets:professions` converter scaffold, and a bijection test green on
the empty set. i18n: the `hudChrome.professions` English block with five
non-Latin M16 fills per wordy row. Validation: `tsc` clean and the
13-file matrix green (architecture, the mobile guard trio, client_shell,
S3, completeness, css corpus and validity, the three new suites,
mobile_controls). frontend-seam-reviewer returned zero blocking; both
should-fixes landed in-phase (the perk line now interpolates the craft
name in one key instead of concatenating localized fragments, and the
bar fill moved into the view core with pins). Screenshots under
`docs/screenshots/professions-wheel-window/`. Notes: `CRAFT_MAX_SKILL`
(300) lives in the view core as a presentational cap because content
defines no craft-side maximum and sim craft skill is uncapped;
`data-icon="target"` is the accepted launcher glyph until designer crest
art arrives; the `gather_fishing` icon ships ahead of its Phase 11 read,
and the painter's gathering name map gains the fishing row plus its
catalog key in Phase 11. The minimap launcher is the rail's eighteenth
micro-button, which broke the 1366x768 side-rail height budget; the
short-viewport compaction gap tightened from 2px to 1px (652px of the
660px budget) with the `crafting_launcher` guard re-pinned deliberately;
the next button added must revisit the rail (DESIGN.md phase 3 replaces
it with the launcher hub).

Phase 5 QA (2026-07-18): PASS with fixes. QA-start HEAD aee72d830 (the
PR 2145 merge; the phase diff is that merge's FIRST-PARENT diff, the
branch having absorbed the #2133 SFX sweep mid-phase). Three packet
audits plus the two matched dispatch-matrix rows (frontend seam,
qa-checklist; no sim/server/wire/database row matched the pure-UI
diff), all five reports complete first try under hard tool-call
budgets. Zero blocking findings. Landed from the audit: the simplified
raise-vs-start CTA decision moved from the painter into the view core
as a SimplifiedCta union on SimplifiedCallToAction (model logic the
both-worlds core tests could not reach), both arms pinned; the three
unconsumed Hud wrappers (openProfessions, closeProfessions,
professionsWindowOpen) dropped, toggleProfessions staying the one
consumed entry point (closeDeeds and deedsWindowOpen carry the same
dead-member debt pre-existing, left alone); sixteen new test pins
across the three suites: the painter's simplified/syncing surface (the
whole pre-cprof online render path had no DOM test), unknown gathering
id renders no row plus all-unknown omits the section, above-display-cap
saturation (pips, fraction, and max above 300, not only at it),
missing-craft-key-equals-zero signature equivalence (a materializing
zero can never trigger a spurious rebuild), gathering maxSkill as its
own signature dimension, unknown-major null arc, the raise CTA and
specialized perk-line interpolation arms, ring node/arc/chord emission
gating, opener-focus restore-once, the PERK_THRESHOLDS uniformity
premise behind the single perk explainer, and an icons manifest
lockstep guard that reads asset-manifest.json itself (the deed crests
are deed_prof_*, a separate namespace; two audit reports misread them
as prof_* and dissolved on verification). Live verification:
mobile_tray_overflow OK (19 buttons, none clipped) and an 18-assertion
probe over the real dev client, all green (desktop Shift+KeyP, Esc,
minimap button, stubbed attuned full mode with arc, chord, ten rows,
perks, and switch cost 8, mobile More-tray open and close, no NaN in
any state). Copy verified against sim constants: per-tier masterwork
odds (MASTERWORK_PER_TIER_ABOVE_CHANCE) and the specialization
material discount are real mechanics. Deferred with reasons: the
switch-cost line rendering for never-attuned full-mode players (the
amendment scopes the line without an attunement condition; maintainer
copy call); richer CTA copy for the practically unreachable
specialized-boundary corner (points stay arithmetically correct since
the 75 threshold coincides with a tier boundary, documented in the
core; a new key would need M16 fills); RingArc endpoint symmetry with
RingChord (painter-side SVG assembly, math unit-pinned); the
pr_shot_targets stateIsFn dual-shape guard (harmless script
robustness); painter open-while-open and toggle branch pins (low
value); a real-ClientWorld pre-sync empty-craftSkills pin (belongs to
a Phase 3 net suite; the missing-key signature equivalence covers the
risk). Also corrected: the state.md screenshot-convention drift note
claimed a docs/pr-screenshots/ convention that never existed in the
tree; the packet's shots live under docs/screenshots/ per root
CLAUDE.md.

### Phase 6: Crafting window upgrades and celebrations
- [x] Recipe rows show profession + required skill + skill-gain difficulty tint (#2037)
- [x] Combo rows name their requirement; station-bound rows show a badge and disable reason
- [x] Masterwork toast + zone-visible broadcast (Phase 4 soft-zone mechanism); tier-up toasts; maker's mark and masterwork in item tooltips
- [x] Online inspect carries instance payloads (identity wire extended, parity pinned)
- [x] Craft button never lies: same eligibility rule as the sim in both hosts (shared craftSkillGainMultiplier and combo_eligibility)

### Phase 7: The Guild letter and quest objectives
- [x] Trending-pair classifier: pure, deterministic, own module (`src/sim/professions/trend.ts`; `GUILD_LETTER_SKILL_THRESHOLD` = `TIER_SKILL_STEP`), unit-tested (closes the #1295 gap)
- [x] The Guild letter arrives via the mail system on trend detection: exactly one pair-correct `guild_trend_` letter on a fresh crossing; backfill single-fire for legacy high-skill saves; attuned and threshold-hovering characters never (re)receive it (`guildLetterSent` one-shot, the `mailWelcomed` shape)
- [x] Letter content id-based in `src/sim/content/letters.ts` (10 pair-keyed letters naming Smith Haldren, the stand-in master until Phase 8); `entities.letters` coverage via `LETTER_IDS` and `LETTERS_BY_ID`; M16 fills in the five non-Latin overlays
- [x] S3 scanner gap closed for good: `src/sim/quests/quest_commands.ts` was ALREADY in scan scope (PR 2039); every player-facing string verified covered; scan-list membership now pinned by a meta-guard in `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`
- [x] Tutorial-panel timing item: no defect exists (the surface is the pure derived hint in `profession_identity_view.ts`, correct by construction); pinned by test
- Note: the "craft/gather quest objective types" line above predated the approved amendments; the letter rides `q_archetype_acceptance` (gather objective, shipped with PR 2039), so no new objective types were needed.

### Phase 8: Stations and masters (sim and server)
- [x] Station registry generalizes `requiresHubStation` to typed stations (forge, kitchens, apothecary, tannery, loom, toolworks); `CRAFTING_HUB_MIN_LEVEL` retired (`src/sim/professions/stations.ts` + `STATIONS`/`STATION_TYPE_BY_CRAFT` content; `recipe.stationType`; stable deny id `station_required`; `crafting_hub.ts` deleted with every consumer migrated; no recipe strands, the nine former hub recipes craft at their typed stations)
- [x] Master NPC records for the six deep crafts, spread across the three zone hubs (four archetype anchors in zone 1; tannery in Fenbridge; apothecary in Highwatch; assignment pinned in `tests/professions_station_placement.test.ts`)
- [x] Automated placement-safety test: no profession NPC or station within aggro-plus-buffer of hostile spawns (content-derived buffer, per-zone camps, mutation-proven failable)
- [x] Mobile crafting station perk activates (bypasses the station gate for the placed craft's station type; specialization-gated `place_mobile_station` wire command in both worlds with the `mst` self-delta mirror, plus a `/dev mobilestation` arm)

### Phase 9: Station presence and recipe training
- [x] Stations render as world props (`src/render/stations.ts` + pure `stations_core.ts`; existing GLBs only, no radius decal); the six masters map to existing NPC visual keys; token-colored, tier-identical `station` minimap marker in both host shapes
- [x] Skill-tier-gated recipe training at masters on the `acquireRecipe` gate (`src/sim/professions/training.ts`: `teachTierMet` is exactly the locked predicate; fees 0/25s/1g by tier, server-side, charged exactly once) with the visible locked-row ladder in the Train view (`src/ui/hud/vendor/train_view.ts` + painter); every existing recipe grandfathered known via the flag-discriminated `recipesGrandfathered` normalize-on-load (frozen 21-id `PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS`; legacy fixture test green); the three combo recipes are the wave-one trainer-taught set; new recipes default trained-not-known (pinned)
- [x] Master shops stocked: each master sells the premium reagents its own station's recipes consume (tinker_gizzel all six; darva/ottilie/hesk thorium_ore; Bree unchanged), closing the Phase 8 travel-loop flag; training fees are gold sinks
- [x] Hands-vs-stations split confirmed live (landed in Phase 8; the `FIELD_RECIPES` OPEN item resolves as the default: the nine commons stay field-craftable, recorded in state.md)

### Phase 10: Recipe ladders and materials content
- [x] Tier ladders for all six deep crafts (common through rare at minimum) with material families (`LADDER_RECIPES` in `src/sim/content/recipes.ts`: 54 trainer recipes, 9 per craft, 3 per rung at skillReq 0/25/50; outputs and materials in the new `src/sim/content/profession_items.ts`; no epic rung, per the locked wave-one ladder)
- [x] Cloth sourcing: humanoid components + plant fiber; corpse component quest-item collision ended (`homespun_cloth` via the new cloth componentTag on humanoids, the herb ladder serves as plant fiber; `HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS` remapped to dedicated materials, quest items keep their questId-gated kill-loot roles, regression suite `tests/harvest_component_materials.test.ts`)
- [x] Economy invariant test pinned: no recipe vendors for more than its inputs (`tests/recipe_economy.test.ts`, strict less-than over every recipe in ALL_RECIPES with vendor reagents priced at purchase price; 14 pre-Phase-10 violators ride the frozen `LEGACY_GOLD_POSITIVE_RECIPE_IDS` exception list, a Phase 15 burn-down target pinned three ways)
- [x] Cross-tier composition; combat-worthy consumables at every cooking/alchemy tier; materialTierBonus wired; the perfect specimen (every rung-50 recipe consumes a lower-band material, pinned; food/potion/elixir outputs at every rung inside the existing power curves; `src/sim/professions/material_tier.ts` at 0.01 per tier, max-tier rule, tier-0 contributes exactly 0 so parity goldens are unchanged; `pristine_hide`/`pristine_silk`/`pristine_venom_gland`/`prime_cut` granted signed at rare+ on the existing corpse rarity roll)
- [x] Wiki content regenerated; recipe data feeds the guide (regenerates clean with zero diff; the generator does not yet enumerate recipe records, so the guide skeleton is unchanged, and the professions guide rewrite stays the Phase 15 deliverable)

### Phase 11: Fishing joins the framework
- [ ] Fishing proficiency (additive, framework-integrated) while the minigame stays as-is
- [ ] Catch rarity ladder feeds cooking tiers; rare catch integrates (deed intact)

### Phase 12: Base tool tier gating
- [ ] Nodes carry tiers; tool tier + skill gate node and corpse-material access
- [ ] The 15 existing tools change outcomes; stale no-op test pin replaced
- [ ] Tool effects remain parked (explicitly out of scope)

### Phase 13: Enchanting reachable
- [ ] Disenchant + enchant-apply + salvage on IWorld, wire commands, bags context UI, both hosts
- [ ] Enchanting skill visible in the wheel window

### Phase 14: Attunement quests and nudges
- [ ] Acceptance lore quests at the masters for all four wave-one archetypes
- [ ] Repeatable-quest support; make-amends wired; cheap-first-switch costs
- [ ] Trend nudges (chat first, Guild letter voice); attunement summary explains everything before commit
- [ ] Work-order quests per master (cadence-capped) and one-shot-per-tier master mail
- [ ] Title celebration on attunement

### Phase 15: Deeds, tuning, and polish
- [ ] Universal profession deeds incl. titles + marquee renown on first attunement and first masterwork, the Specialist deed, and the rare-find deeds (plus the rare fish, verified)

## Notes

(append per-phase notes, deferrals, and surprises here as sessions complete)

2026-07-17 design-review amendments: a maintainer design review (the
response to the external Codex review) amended the packet between Phases 2
and 3. state.md records the rulings under "2026-07-17 design-review
amendments"; the owning phase and QA files, the cross-cutting docs, and the
asset manifest carry the updated deliverables (see the amendment PR's diff
for the full file list). The any-signed masterwork condition ships as its
own code change ahead of Phase 3, verified by the Phase 3 pre-flight. The
checklists above were updated in the same pass; unchecked items describe
the AMENDED deliverables.

Phase 2 (2026-07-17): phase-start commit 9a5ce7a93 (the Phase 1 QA merge,
the release/v0.27.0 head); code-final commit 90ba58f17 (the
professions_craft parity golden); the docs commit follows it, so the QA
session diffs 9a5ce7a93..branch-head. Implemented on the worktree branch
feature/professions-2-phase-02-masterwork. Validation: whole-repo tsc
clean; the six phase suites (204 tests), the new and reader suites (122),
the net/wire row (377), and tests/parity (174 passed, one pre-existing
env-gated skip) all green; the full gate passed every stage except the
known environmental armory browser failure (PR CI is the arbiter), with
typecheck and the env/server/client builds finished manually per the
established playbook. Reviews: six read-only reviewers (architecture,
cross-platform-sync, privacy-security, migration-safety, qa-checklist,
test-coverage-auditor), zero blocking and zero unresolved should-fix
findings; the archetype-ceiling-gates-masterwork semantic and the
chore-first commit order are deliberate and explained in the commit
bodies. Deferred and surfaced items live in the Phase 2 drift notes in
state.md: the rollback enchantability caveat for the release notes, the
two battlefield trickle questions, the guide prose deferral to Phases 6
and 15, and the standing instance-payload wire invariant.

2026-07-19 Phase 6 (crafting window upgrades and celebrations) landed on
feature/professions-2-phase-06-crafting-window off release/v0.28.0
(phase-start 0a4fd8078, the Phase 5 QA merge). All five checklist rows
check; #2037's scope closes with the PR (close by hand at merge,
release-branch merges never auto-close). Both sanctioned seam touches
landed as specified: announceMasterworkZone (a new structured
masterworkZone SimEvent riding the exported Phase 4 emitToZonePlayers,
rng-free, instance space excluded) and the eqi identity-wire inspect
extension (server-trimmed to signer/enchant/rolled, mirrored into
ClientWorld equippedInstances, no new IWorld member). As-landed
deviations, all recorded in the state.md Phase 6 surfaces entry: NO
sim_i18n matcher row exists (the broadcast is text-free ids+values on
the gatherRareEvent precedent; the S3 guard passes by construction);
the celebration gate is the deeds pure-plan style (no fireworks module
exists; reduced motion trims only the banner fade, information and the
ARIA announcer never gated); the parity golden professions_craft
eventDigest was re-pinned deliberately (the crafter's own zone copy,
rng fingerprints byte-identical); armory_inspect.ts is the cosmetic
skin panel, the real gear-inspect surface is hud openInspect (threaded
there). Five-reviewer fan-out (architecture, cross-platform-sync,
frontend-seam, privacy-security, qa-checklist): zero blocking; all four
should-fixes landed in-phase (shared craftSkillGainMultiplier consumed
by sim and view, eqi payload data minimization with a negative pin,
the tier-up diff bounded to a post-craftResult drain window, a real
plan.motion consumer). Deferred: the enchanted marker names the STATE
only (EnchantDef.name has no localized display surface; a named enchant
line needs an i18n surface first, Phase 13/15 candidate); bags/bank
grid painters still pass the def only where no instance exists on the
row (correct today); the online two-banner corner (masterwork and
tier-up can land in separate drains online, each keeps its own banner,
cosmetic only).

Phase 6 QA (2026-07-19): PASS with fixes. QA diff 0a4fd8078..206b0ffe7
(the PR 2150 merge, linear, eight commits). The whole validation matrix
ran green at the untouched tip first (tsc, the seventeen matched
suites, the mobile guard trio, i18n:gen plus completeness), so every
audit agent got already-verified ground instead of re-running suites.
Eight-agent fan-out (three packet audits plus the five matched dispatch
rows: frontend-seam, cross-platform-sync, architecture,
privacy-security, qa-checklist), all eight complete first try under
hard tool-call budgets with schema-forced structured output. Zero
blocking findings. Landed from the audit: tier_unmet now names the
unmet craft(s) (the acceptance criterion the painter missed: the view
threaded unmetCrafts but the status line rendered the generic
both-crafts sentence; the new comboTierUnmetNamed key renders only the
under-tier craft names with the required tier, the param-less key stays
the defensive fallback so no existing locale fill goes stale or loses a
placeholder, M16 fills in the five non-Latin overlays, jsdom pins for
the single, multi, and fallback arms); the tier-up armed drain window
moved from hud.ts into observeCraftSkillsForTierUps beside the plan
builder (four reviewers converged on the untested state machine; the
Phase 5 painter-to-core precedent; hud is now a three-line consumer
with identical behavior and the armed-window edges are unit-pinned,
including the delayed-toast contract for a crossing that outlives the
window); a live GameServer masterworkZone routing suite (three
sessions, the real sim.tick into routeEvents pump, each in-zone session
receives exactly its own recipient-pid copy, the other-zone session
receives nothing; the hcb broadcast-suite precedent, standing in for
the two-browser online probe since no local Postgres exists); threading
pins for the bags forwarding call site, the char_window self-mirror
closure, the openInspect slot rows, and the hud.itemTooltip composition
order; plan.motion consumer pins (banner-no-motion and the never-gated
ARIA announcer); DOM pins for the none band, the in-range station
badge, and the hover-tooltip sentence; dead imports dropped
(tierProgressMultiplier in crafting.ts, Stats in hud.ts) and the
emitToZonePlayers export comment corrected. Live verification: an
18-check puppeteer probe over the real dev client, all green (21 recipe
rows with skill line, difficulty text, and aria fold-in; 9 station
badges, every out-of-range row with its inline reason note; the three
difficulty bands driven live including the free floor and the unattuned
ceiling arm; a real tier-up crossing through the armed-window path at
the 25 and 50 boundaries with banner and chat line; reduced motion
keeping the text while setting banner-no-motion; masterwork and
legacy-signed tooltips over the real bags surface). Deferred with
reasons: the station out-of-range copy omits the level arm of the
predicate (Phase 8 retires CRAFTING_HUB_MIN_LEVEL, revisit with the
masters rework); the bounded 100-drain window can delay a toast past
severe mirror lag until the next armed window (deliberate, no per-frame
poll); the pre-cprof difficulty label transient (documented,
presentation-neutral); two procs in one drain coalesce to one
masterworkToast log line (zone and loot lines still per proc); the
crafter's third-person zone line beside their own toast (deliberate,
parity-pinned); eqi cosmetic payloads reach every interest-scoped
client like eq (identity-record semantics); the server eqi build shares
a live rolled reference (JSON-snapshotted per broadcast, server-owned,
no leak); the #ffd100 seal literal (matches the soulbound idiom,
tokenization is DESIGN.md territory) and the rule-less
tt-instance-bonus hook class; the guide.ts reword leaving Latin overlay
fills stale until the release-tier refill (standard workflow);
archetypeCeilingFor computed twice per resolveCraftForRecipe
(behavior-neutral).

2026-07-19 Phase 7 (the Guild letter) landed on
feature/professions-2-phase-07-guild-letter off the release/v0.28.0 tip
8e88b27f5 (the phase-start commit for the QA diff). Three-agent build
fan-out plus a four-reviewer dispatch (architecture,
cross-platform-sync, migration-safety, frontend-seam), zero blocking;
two review fixes landed: the letter trigger books mail through the NEW
append-only SimContext callback mailAuthoredLetter instead of a raw
injected PostOffice (registry, createSimContext passthrough, both test
stub hosts, and the pinned callback list all updated), and
entity_i18n.ts LETTERS_BY_ID now mirrors GUILD_TREND_LETTERS (the
parallel-registry drift cross-platform-sync confirmed; the
localization_coverage world-entry count formula was re-pinned to
include the 10 letters, a deliberate count re-pin, no rng golden
touched). Surprises: the phase file's S3 premise was stale (scan
coverage landed with PR 2039, so the deliverable reduced to the
membership meta-guard plus per-string verification);
nearTier/dormantKnowledge live in profession_identity_view.ts, not
wheel.ts; letters localize via entities.letters + LETTER_IDS, not the
i18n catalog, and the letter emits no free sim text, so no sim_i18n
matcher row was needed. Deliberate content choice for the design owner:
only the four wave-one archetype pairs name their titles in the letter
body (the other six titles exist in hudChrome.archetypePair but would
promise pre-Phase-14 content). Deploy note: a deploy, rollback,
roll-forward sequence can re-fire one duplicate letter (the
mailWelcomed precedent, cosmetic). Golden caution for future scenario
authors: an unattuned character with a craft pair sum of 25 or more
ticked past the 90 second delivery delay starts emitting guild_trend
mailArrived events into event digests. Fixed in passing: the status
table's Phase 6 QA row (completion was recorded in Notes but the row
still said not started). Phase 7 QA plays the vertical-slice checkpoint
(phase-07-qa.md).

2026-07-19 Phase 7 QA complete: PASS with fixes, zero blocking. Seven
agent fan-out (correctness, test-coverage, dead-code packet audits plus
migration-safety, cross-platform-sync, architecture, qa-checklist per
the dispatch matrix; privacy-security, database-performance, and
frontend-seam did not match the diff), 5 should-fix findings deduping to
3 unique, all fixed on the QA branch: (1) the online path was verified
live by inspection by three agents independently but had no pin, closed
by the live GameServer session-routing suite
tests/guild_letter_online.test.ts (owner-only mailArrived with exact
payload, mailU unread mirror 2 vs 1, booking-level one-shot when a
second pair qualifies); (2) the activeArchetype eligibility clause had
no isolating negative (the attuned test flips two fields at once),
closed by per-clause unit negatives on the exported
maybeSendGuildTrendLetter plus a flip-before-send spy pin, both
mutation-verified (deleting the guard or the finiteness check each
kills exactly one test); (3) no same-seed determinism pin for the sweep
through the real Sim, closed with an identical-arrival-tick run-twice
test. Also landed: skillOf now enforces its own positive-FINITE comment
contract (Number.isFinite; Infinity or NaN in a malformed save can no
longer classify as crossed), the system MailKind and Guild sender
pinned on the real mailInfo mailbox surface, a two-player same-sweep
case, and the letters.ts header enumerating all four authored families.
The vertical-slice checkpoint (kernel exit) PLAYED end to end in the
seeded offline world: pristine vein fired at harvest 41 with the finder
line and x5 signed mats; crafting surfaced loot line, XP, Crafted line,
Made By Hand deed, live identity-card skill movement and the first-tier
next-unlock hint; the crossing craft flipped guildLetterSent 12 ticks
later (the 1 Hz sweep) and the raven landed at exactly 90 seconds with
banner, whisper cue, chat line, correct pair letter (system kind, The
Crafting Guild) whose body names the Smith title and Smith Haldren; the
acceptance quest flow attuned the pair through the 10-archetype chooser
with its live Result line (Title Smith, majors uncapped, hobby
Leatherworking); a masterwork procced with the full-screen marquee,
personal toast line, AND the zone-broadcast line; the sole-copy
masterwork traded to a second player with signer + rolled.masterwork +
stats payload intact. ONE experiential finding, DEFERRED to the
maintainer (design decision): the letter's call to action dead-ends for
a player who has not done q_prof_intro, Smith Haldren shows only his
greeting and vendor line (q_archetype_acceptance reads unavailable
behind requiresQuest, no locked-row hint, no redirect to Foreman
Odell), so the letter's promise silently fails for exactly its target
audience (players who leveled crafts without the mining intro); options
recorded: a locked-quest hint row in the dialog, a letter-body pointer
to the Copper Dig (needs the 5 overlay refills), or softening the
requiresQuest gate when skills already qualify. Observations, no
action: the starter weapon recipe (arming sword) can never masterwork,
masterworkBonusStats is null for its stat-less def, so the tier-1 Smith
proc path is the caster-stat warded leggings (design note for Phase
8/10 recipe ladders); zone-1 pristine copper feeds no recipe (the
recorded Phase 4 zone-1 mitigation), so the signed-mats-into-craft link
starts with battlefield-drop reagents or zone 2+; trade removal prefers
fungible copies, a signed copy transfers only when it is the only copy
(the recorded Phase 3 model, a specific-instance offer UX is a future
call); the mail arrival banner is lost if the recipient is offline when
the raven lands (pre-existing PostOffice announce semantics, welcome
letter identical); an old client renders an unknown guild_trend_
letterId as the raw id (pre-existing letters behavior, system-wide
resolver fallback filed as a future nicety). NITs recorded, not worth
churn: source-scan pins tolerate commented-out entries (accepted
precedent), replaceAll clarity in the letterId scheme, the sweep bills
to the postOffice lap bucket, a third backfill load, a dedicated parity
scenario (the determinism pin covers the risk, the sweep draws zero
rng). Release cut reminder: the 10 letters' pending rows for the
non-M16 locales fill at the release-tier gate as usual.

2026-07-19 Phase 8 (stations and masters) landed on
feature/professions-2-phase-08-stations-masters off the release/v0.28.0
tip 571ab0219 (the phase-start commit for the QA diff). Three-agent
sequential build workflow (sim, content, tests) plus a six-reviewer
dispatch (privacy-security, cross-platform-sync, architecture,
frontend-seam, migration-safety, qa-checklist), zero blocking; the one
should-fix (a stale optimistic-mirror doc comment on the
activeMobileStationCraft facet member) was fixed with two follow-up
guard tests (recipe-stamp stranding guard, mst expiry-to-null arm).
Notable calls: the online liveness gap the build left (ClientWorld's
activeMobileStationCraft pinned null) was closed IN-PHASE with the mst
self-delta mirror rather than deferred, because a disabled online
Craft button beside an active mobile station is exactly the 2033 stub
class; the parity goldens were regenerated in their own commit for the
six static NPCs' purely mechanical +6 entity-id shift (id-family keys
only, draw order untouched, determinism arms green); the Tools of the
Trade deed desc was reworded station-neutral with the 18 stale locale
desc fills dropped for the release refill. Surprises: the
placement-safety buffer is bound by bursar_fernando against the boar
camp (11.19), not smith_haldren against the wolves (12.34) as
predicted; sim/items.ts rejects vendor rows without a positive
buyValue, so several natural reagent stocks were dead rows (tanner and
weaver stocks are flavor picks instead); deleting an i18n catalog key
hard-fails tsc on every overlay still carrying it (the retire recipe
is catalog delete + orphan-row delete + i18n:gen in one pass); the
RELEASE TIP ITSELF was red in tests/chronomancy.test.ts (the absorbed
PR 2154 barrier-scaling merge missed the chronomancy absorb pins),
repaired here in its own labeled commit (184/84 to 194/94, the
documented 25 percent spell-power term). Content flow note for the
maintainer: the six premium reagents still sell only at Quartermaster
Bree in Highwatch while the toolworks/loom/forge recipes now craft in
Eastbrook, a deliberate buy-then-travel loop to reconsider in Phase 9
stocking. STILL OPEN (unchanged from Phase 7): the Guild letter's
call to action dead-ends pre-q_prof_intro; the masters ship with
EMPTY questIds hooks and no redirect was silently implemented.

Phase 8 QA (2026-07-19): PASS with fixes, zero blocking. Nine-agent
fan-out (three packet audits plus privacy-security, migration-safety,
cross-platform-sync, architecture, frontend-seam and the closing
qa-checklist; database-performance did not match the diff), every
agent complete first try under the 30-call budget, with the phase
validation matrix pre-verified green at the untouched tip and passed
to every agent as ground. The correctness audit ran six live
headless-Sim probes (deny away from the station, wrong-type deny,
at-station success, all nine field recipes far from any station, the
full mobile place/craft/expire cycle against real ticks, caster-recipe
radius behavior at 19 vs 30 out) plus proof that FIELD_RECIPES equals
the pre-phase nine COMMON_RECIPES ids. Findings: 18 total, 3
should-fix, all fixed: the Phase 9 phase file still pointed its
reader at the deleted crafting_hub.ts (swept to stations.ts and the
crafting.ts gate), the /dev mobilestation arm had zero coverage (now
proves the cheat routes through the real specialization gate), and
the hud station_required deny toast had no binding pin (source-pinned
in profession_identity_card.test.ts). Fixed NITs: the FIELD_RECIPES
set pin was a tautology against its own definition source (now pins
the nine literal ids), the mobile expiry boundary was only incidental
(exact strict-below pin added: active at expiry-1, expired at the
expiry tick), and two comments (stations.ts header, CraftResultView)
implied a mobile-arm proximity check the spec'd gate deliberately
does not have (reworded). Dissolved on verification: the
crafting_hub test filename misnomer (its header documents the
deliberate keep for the deeds.ts anchors), the hud fallthrough
mislabel (unreachable by construction and documented in-code), the
slow-band set allocation (cold painter, throttled, pre-phase
equivalent), and the place_mobile_station rate-limit worry
(self-scoped transient slot overwrite, no growth, no rng, no db).
Closed decisively: guide freshness (wiki:content regenerates no
diff; the guide does not enumerate town NPCs). Deferred with notes
in state.md: the Eastbrook loom-toolworks radius overlap (design
observation for Phase 9 props and minimap), the consumer-less
MobileCraftingStation pos/placedAtTick/playerId fields (Phase 9
props are the natural consumer), the expired station object
lingering on the meta slot until the next placement (benign, every
reader checks isStationActive), and the mobile-viewport station row
being screenshot-verified only.

2026-07-19 Phase 9 (station presence and recipe training) landed on
feature/professions-2-phase-09-station-training off release/v0.28.0
tip d40f0a90f (the phase-start commit for the QA diff; re-resolve the
merge commit at PR time). Build was a three-agent parallel Workflow
(sim/wire, render, ui) in one shared worktree with a fixed interface
contract plus a tests agent after; all four completed first try.
Decisions this phase made (maintainer-visible, none altering a locked
state.md decision): the wave-one trainer-taught set is the three
COMBO_RECIPES (skillReq 25, exactly the locked "uncommon at 25" rung;
commons and the 75/150 TOOL/CASTER recipes keep empty acquisition,
grandfathered known to everyone by the isRecipeKnown arm, per the
locked wording); grandfathering is a flag-discriminated
normalize-on-load (recipesGrandfathered, mailWelcomed idiom) that
unions the frozen 21-id PRE_TRAINING_RECIPE_IDS into any save missing
the flag, so legacy characters keep the combos while new characters
train them; training proximity accepts STATIC stations only (a mobile
crafting station never satisfies training, pinned); the crafting
window now lists known recipes only (unlearned trainer recipes
surface in the Train ladder instead). Deferrals with reasons: the
train_not_taught_here deny arm has no positive test (content-
unreachable until a drop/quest acquisition recipe exists; precedence
pinned, Phase 10 owns content); the mobile-station prop stays
deferred (pos/placedAtTick still consumer-less); visualKeyFor pins
for the six master ids and a tokens-coverage pin for
--color-minimap-station were skipped as optional; the i18n
semantic-regressions suite is gate-tier only (no locale prose
reworded). Surprises recorded to memory: the parity harness pins new
persisted PlayerMeta fields by default (the 55-golden regen is
exactly the recipesGrandfathered field, its own reviewed commit);
resolveCraft denies combo_requirement_unmet before recipe_not_learned;
wardweave_cowl/duskhide_wraps/sootscale_mantle genuinely consume
thorium_ore, so the master-stock mapping is thorium-heavy by content,
not by choice.

Phase 9 QA (2026-07-19): PASS with fixes, zero blocking. Ten-agent
fan-out (three packet audits plus privacy-security, migration-safety,
cross-platform-sync, architecture, frontend-seam, test-coverage-
auditor and the closing qa-checklist; database-performance did not
match the diff), with the phase validation matrix pre-verified green
at the untouched tip and passed to every agent as ground. Seven of
ten completed inside the Workflow; frontend-seam, privacy-security
and qa-checklist finished their investigations but failed structured
delivery and were re-dispatched fresh via the Agent tool (the
established recovery recipe), all completing there. Played behavior
was verified twice over: the correctness audit ran six live
headless-Sim probes (exact-balance train to zero, key-absent legacy
blob, mobile-station craft beside the training deny, same-row ladder
flip, multi-violation deny order, a grandfathered common crafted at
skill 0), and the orchestrator drove the real offline client over
CDP (gossip Train option, tier deny with the named "You need Alchemy
25" line, exact-fee train, replay deny with no re-charge, fee-1
cannot-afford, out-of-range, the 8yd proximity auto-close, the
crafting-window known-filter in both directions, the station minimap
marker and token, trained-not-known on a fresh character); the
online arm rests on the live GameServer routing suite plus the
snapshots cprof-mirror pin, both re-verified decisive. All nine
acceptance criteria hold. Fixes landed: the exactly-affordable fee
edge (copper equal to fee) pinned at the Sim level; per-pair deny
reason-to-key mapping pins (a key swap inside the hud ternary chain
previously passed every pin); isStationMasterNpc parametrized over
all six STATIONS masters with a smith_haldren negative; a same-row
locked-to-teachable flip pin at the 24/25 boundary; a full
multi-violation deny-order pin; an explicit server-side
recipesGrandfathered-true pin on a fresh online join; a key-absent
(pre-#1299) legacy-save arm; and the accepted rollback caveat turned
into a pin (a full current-shape blob stripped of the flag re-unions
on return, fee-free, exactly the state.md release-notes wording).
One frontend should-fix landed as a small extraction: the
viewer-side knownness predicate was duplicated between the crafting
window filter and the train ladder, now shared as train_view.ts
isRecipeKnownForViewer (both call sites delegate; the known-filter
source pin deliberately re-pinned to the delegation), and rowState
now calls the sim's own teachTierMet instead of restating it.
Dissolved on verification (the seventh phase running): the
correctness agent's claim that the legacy fixture shape was wrong
(knownRecipes existed at phase start d40f0a90f; the hand-frozen
fixture is a genuine pre-Phase-9 shape). Deferred with reasons: the
unknown-deny-reason fallback renders the out-of-range line instead
of nothing (reachable only under client/server version skew on a
closed 5-member union; maintainer call for a later phase); a
same-state same-craft mobile-craft-versus-training-deny contrast is
impossible in wave-one content (no plain station-gated alchemy
recipe and no engineering trainer recipe exist; covered by
cross-suite composition plus the live probe); the tokens-coverage
pin for --color-minimap-station stays the accepted build-time
deferral; the pr_shot_targets forge position literals are
script-only. Privacy INFO for the economy owner: the master
stocking makes thorium_ore and the six premium reagents purchasable
in zones 1 and 2 where previously only quartermaster_bree (zone 3)
sold them; deliberate, no price/arbitrage loop. The closing
qa-checklist returned READY (zero blocking, zero should-fix); its
five verify items all closed from session ground: the architecture
suite ran green in the matrix, the fee table matches the state.md
tuning targets verbatim (common free, uncommon 25s, rare 1g), the
asset budget output is byte-identical to phase start (zero public/
changes; its red rows are pre-existing debt outside the gate), guide
freshness rides the gate's pretest wiki:content plus
tests/guide.test.ts, and mobile rests on the green mobile window
suites plus the phase's committed mobile screenshots (live mobile
E2E not re-run, the Phase 8-precedent deferral). Its remaining INFO,
a dedicated train_recipe rate limit, stays optional: the command is
idempotent (already-known denies without charging) and the global
command cadence limiter applies.

Phase 10 (2026-07-19): recipe ladders and materials content, built as
an ultracode Workflow off phase-start 720efc89f (the Phase 9 QA merge;
the QA diff is the PR's commits off that tip). Orchestration: two
parallel writer agents (materials/collision/specimen, and the
materialTierBonus wiring) with disjoint file ownership, then six
parallel craft designers returning structured ladders to scratchpad
JSON, folded in by three sequential integration passes (one commit per
craft pair) and a dedicated economy-test writer, with the validation
matrix run green at the tip before the review fan-out. Quest credit
was verified BEFORE the harvest remap landed: all three collect quests
(q_boars, q_spiders, q_widows) have questId-gated kill-loot drops on
their own mobs, so no quest lost its source. Key as-landed calls, all
swept into both phase-10 files: the economy invariant carries a frozen
14-member legacy exception list (8 commons, the 3 caster-hub rows, the
3 combos; measured, pinned three ways, Phase 15 burn-down) because
fixing the legacy sellValues would break the prime directive inside a
content phase; the perfect specimen grants IN ADDITION to the plain
component at rare+ (specimen-less families keep the old signed-regular
behavior); every new recipe including the skillReq-0 rungs is
station-bound and trainer-taught (coexists with the grandfathered
field commons); materialTierBonus keys off def-level material tier
bands, not consumed-instance rarity (instances do not report which
copy was consumed); the six raw fish already existed so no fish
ItemDefs were authored; no new deeds (recipes and materials are not
conquerable content per docs/design/deeds.md). Deferred with reasons:
guide recipe enumeration (Phase 15 professions guide rewrite), the
recipeForResultItem reverse-lookup gap for non-common tables
(pre-existing), a single shared battle-elixir aura slot (maintainer
call; per-item power stays capped at the bear's 12), and the legacy
gold-positive burn-down (Phase 15).

Phase 10 QA (2026-07-19): PASS with fixes, zero blocking. Verified off
the merge af7ac3d8b (QA diff 720efc89f..ad2bbbe92; the merge's first
parent 8564d1ee2 was concurrent release movement with zero file
overlap, verified). Method: validation matrix green at the untouched
tip first (19 suites incl. the five item-content convention suites,
727 tests, wiki:content zero diff), four live played beats (train with
the full deny ladder and exact fees, station-bound craft end to end,
rare+ specimen dual grant with zero quest-item leakage across 400
seeds, mid-objective q_boars save-compat with a working turn-in, and
the materialTierBonus 10000-craft odds decisively above the no-bonus
model), economy-invariant mutation checks (both arms bite), then a
25-agent adversarial-verify Workflow (3 packet audits + the 4
dispatch-matrix reviewers, every finding retried by an independent
skeptic: 14 confirmed, 4 dissolved). The one real sim defect: a corpse
with two specimen families could overflow the bag (the jackpot stole a
later family's reserved plain slot); fixed test-first by granting all
plain yields before any signed instance, draw order untouched. Also
landed: the ladder execution suite (all 54 recipes craft end to end,
specimen consumers, real train rungs, elixir def pins + live use path,
silkspun_satchel capacity), the HARVEST_COMPONENT_SPECIMENS literal
pin plus all-family behavior arms, the train_view locked-row literal
re-pin (formula tautology), item_icons BAG_IDS sixth bag, the stale
TOOL_RECIPE_STUBS sweep, and an itemFallback potion/elixir flask
branch (the eleven new consumables rendered junk-trinket icons).
Deferred with reasons (drift notes in state.md): wolf_fang consumer
(the one demand-rule outlier, Phase 15), recipeForResultItem widening
(a live gameplay switch for the dormant battlefield-XP trickle,
maintainer call), shared battle-elixir exclusivity (maintainer call,
re-confirmed), cooking rungs are sit-heal food only (maintainer
glance), and the retro CI reds on the release push (Release gate
locale shards + version gate) are the branch-wide mid-cycle state,
identical on the pre-phase push, with the Browser job green.
