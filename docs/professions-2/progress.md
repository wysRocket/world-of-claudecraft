## Per-phase deliverable checklists

Each phase file (`phase-NN-*.md`) carries the authoritative acceptance
criteria; mirror the checkboxes here as phases complete.

### Phase 1: Ring and identity foundations
- [x] `CRAFT_RING` adopts the blueprint ring order (design-doc order); geometry tests re-pinned
- [x] `ArchetypeState` carries per-archetype attunement history (JSONB additive, back-compat load)
- [x] Combo eligibility requires the matching attunement in the shared rule, both hosts
- [x] Pair-named archetype title keys land (Smith, Outfitter, Apothecary, Bombardier + the six future pairs)
- [x] PR 2039 should-fix items resolved; ring adoption landed on the PR 2039 head pre-merge

Phase 1 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the packet's
three audit roles plus the full review dispatch matrix (architecture,
frontend seam, cross-platform sync, privacy/security, migration safety,
pin quality, qa-checklist). The save-compat stopping rule was evaluated
and NOT triggered (v0.26.0 shipped the acceptance quests retired, the
ClientWorld archetype methods as no-op stubs, and no UI caller, so no
player-held save carries old-ring pair ids; an executed round-trip fixture
confirmed drop-by-design plus stable canonical ids). QA landed: coverage
additions for the pair helpers, transition state machine, resolved-count
credit, and a same-seed determinism pin; the one loosened hobby re-pin
restored to exact literals; the nythraxis interact-credit site routed
through questObjectiveRequired; a minimal accuracy pass over the
guide.professions wiki prose (full rewrite stays Phase 15). Deferred, with
notes in state.md: the hobby-switch XP repeatable (maintainer balance
decision), the COMBO_RECIPES record field order (cosmetic), legacy
IWorldProfessions member retirement (Phase 15 candidate).

### Phase 2: Masterwork model
- [x] Craft outputs deterministic; five-way quality roll retired; `trivialAt` retired
- [x] Masterwork proc (skill, self-signed, specialization inputs) with pinned rng-draw contract
- [x] Masterwork stats baked via `item_budget` into `instance.rolled.stats`; deeds reader still coherent
- [x] Masterwork SimEvent with celebration payload; power-ceiling tuning targets in `state.md`

Phase 2 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the packet's
three audit roles plus the matched dispatch-matrix rows (architecture,
cross-platform sync, privacy/security, migration safety, pin quality,
qa-checklist; frontend seam and database performance were NO-MATCH for
this diff). The phase-emphasis probes all bind: an inserted extra rng
draw reddens five tests across three suites, a 2-tier bump reddens the
raid-floor bound through its literal tripwire pins (the derived sweep
moves with the model by design; the literal rows are the teeth, never
delete them thinking the sweep suffices), and the legacy rolled.quality
path is proven end to end in both hosts. QA landed: proc-chance wiring
pins through the real craft path (self-signed at hunted seed 69, the
joint specialization-plus-tier 74/75/76 boundary at hunted seed 2,
spares recorded in-file), the ClientWorld craftResult mirror's
masterwork flag, the top-level enchant marker save/load round trip, an
observed-roll pin making the miss-arm's seed-1 premise load-bearing,
an inv-snapshot passthrough pin (masterwork and legacy instance
payloads reach the client byte-identical), and the quality-roll
retirement cleanup (dead clampMaterialRarity deleted with its orphan
test pin; the area CLAUDE.md re-taught the deterministic model). One
audit finding dissolved on verification: the reported vestments armor
anomaly is the displaced starter recruit_tunic (delta 30 minus 20),
not a bug. Deferred with reasons: the 0.15-cap integration hunted pin
(the clamp is pure-function pinned and every term wiring is craft-path
pinned; a fourth hunted seed adds maintenance without coverage), and
the online-inspect equippedInstances gap (pre-existing, recorded in
the state.md drift notes for the Phase 6 surfacing decision).
Mixed-fleet safety verified: the previous release's HUD event if-chain
ignores unknown SimEvent types, so a new server's masterwork event is
harmless to an old client.

Phase 3 QA (2026-07-17): PASS, zero blocking findings across the
packet's three audit roles plus the matched dispatch-matrix rows
(architecture, cross-platform sync, pin quality, qa-checklist;
privacy/security, migration safety, frontend seam, and database
performance were NO-MATCH for the QA diff). One real correctness
defect found and fixed test-first, in the pre-landed PR 2045 trade
code rather than the phase diff: tradeConfirm ran the a-to-b transfer
to completion before removing b's give, so same-itemId bidirectional
trades cross-contaminated (a swapped instance bounced straight back
to its owner; a plain-for-instance offer spared the instance and
mis-routed a plain copy). The swap is now two-phase (removeOffer both
sides, then grantOffer both sides), matching the model fitsAfterSwap
already validated; conservation held in all variants, so no dupe or
loss ever occurred. QA landed: the two sequencing repro pins (revert
experiment confirms both red on the old code and only they guard the
reorder), a partial-stack sparing pin (removePreferFungible must
choose), a no-escrow cancel contract pin, the live GameServer
broadcast suite for hcb (claim-after-first-sight arrives as a lite
dyn-only record, pinned by hcb-present plus no-nm; interest-scope
eviction and re-entry deliver claims AND clears made out of view, and
a delta-guarded mirror mutation reds the clear arm), and the
claimed-corpse arms of corpseLootAvailability (self-claimed viewer,
claimed-by-another, claimed-with-personal-loot stays openable). Docs:
the hcb as-landed deviation swept into the phase file and QA twin
(the amend-the-twin trap), the phantom bandwidth hcb pin claim
corrected (the snapshots sparse-absence assertion is the no-bloat
tooth), the bareClient drift note rescoped to the real 21-copy
repo-wide idiom (extraction filed as #2088, a standalone chore), and
the Phase 4 despawn-grace heads-up recorded. Deferred with reasons: a
bandwidth claimed-corpse scenario (docs now truthful instead; the
sparse-absence pin covers the regression that matters) and a
distinct-itemId slot-order byte-equivalence pin (the push-to-end plus
splice-compaction reasoning is airtight per the architecture review).
- [x] Trade carries `ItemInstancePayload` end to end (regression test)
- [x] `harvestClaimedBy` mirrored online; corpse picker stops offering claimed corpses
- [x] Crafting view consumes the shared combo-eligibility rule in both hosts

Completed 2026-07-17. The trade code fix had pre-landed on release via
PR 2045; this phase added the missing bidirectional full-payload pin
(signer, charges, rolled including the masterwork marker, enchant,
boundTo, both directions in one mixed trade). harvestClaimedBy rides
the per-entity wire as the sparse hcb key (server/game.ts dynamicFields
emit, unconditional ClientWorld reset in src/net/online.ts), pinned by
the round-trip suite in tests/snapshots.test.ts and the online-picker
parity suite in tests/corpse_harvest_sim.test.ts; hcb is deliberately
NOT in ALL_DELTA_KEYS / TERSE_TO_IWORLD (those pin selfWireJson maybe()
self keys; the per-entity round-trip pins are the teeth, with the
snapshots sparse-absence assertion as the no-bloat pin; bandwidth stays
green but has no hcb-specific scenario).
Combo-gating liveness pinned in
tests/crafting_view_combo_liveness.test.ts (Sim and ClientWorld arms
fed by a real cprof broadcast; decisiveness mutation-tested). Review
fan-out (cross-platform-sync, privacy-security, qa-checklist,
test-coverage-auditor): PASS, zero blocking. Deferred to Phase 4:
src/main.ts still passes harvestStateReliable = (online === null) at
the three interaction open-gate sites, so the truthful mirror is not
yet consumed at the online OPEN gate (harvest-only corpses still do
not open online, pre-existing); flip with an open-gate test when
Phase 4 makes gathering trust corpse claims (details in state.md).

### Phase 4: Node materials and pristine veins
- [x] Per-rarity node material tables replace placeholder junk (zone-1 stays low-tier)
- [x] Rare+ node yields signed like corpse yields
- [x] Per-node-type rare events: pristine vein / ancient heartwood / moonlit bloom (spawns, per-flavor soft broadcasts, deed-mark hooks)
- [x] `gatherResult` consumed: gather cue + rarity-colored loot line

Completed 2026-07-18 (phase-start HEAD 4d8b32d09, the release/v0.28.0 tip
with Phase 3 QA aboard). `NODE_MATERIAL_TABLE` in
`src/sim/professions/gathering.ts` grants zone-tiered materials (four new
low-tier defs; zones 2 and 3 reuse the existing recipe-consumed premium
reagents, closing the loop the TOOL_RECIPE_STUBS note forward-declared);
zone 1 grants only the sellValue-4 starters per the stockpiling
mitigation, pinned with a non-vacuous negative arm. resolveHarvest draws
twice (rarity, then the 1/90 rare-event roll in the new
`gather_events.ts` module); the one-draw pins were re-pinned deliberately.
Rare events are five-fold always-signed yields with a per-recipient
soft-zone broadcast (the Phase 6 reuse mechanism; instance space excluded
via DUNGEON_X_THRESHOLD) and dormant `gather_event:<flavor>` deed marks.
The Phase 3 deferral landed: main.ts's three open-gate sites now trust
the hcb mirror (`tests/gather_open_gate.test.ts` pins both arms plus the
pre-existing INTERACT_RANGE + 1 open boundary, which keeps despawn-grace
corpses out of reach). The HUD consumes gatherResult as a rarity-colored
"You gather:" line worded apart from the grant hub's "You receive:" loot
line with no second cue (review catch: the first draft double-logged and
double-played; five-reviewer fan-out, zero blocking after fixes). A new
parity scenario `professions_gather` (seed 3) pins the draw order across
hosts; no existing golden changed. gatherResult gained qty and rareEvent
fields; the cue reuses existing sampled SFX (new cues are
manifest-gated). Deferred: node tier gating (Phase 12), recipe
consumption of the new materials (Phase 10), rare-event deed authoring
(Phase 15), a live-server instance-exclusion broadcast arm (unit-level
covered).

Phase 4 QA (2026-07-18): PASS with fixes. Three packet audits plus the
four matched dispatch-matrix rows (architecture, cross-platform sync,
frontend seam, qa-checklist; privacy/security, migration safety, and
database performance were NO-MATCH), all seven reports complete first
try with the hard tool-call budgets baked in. REAL FIND, fixed
test-first: the signed harvest grant could overflow bag capacity by one
slot per rare-or-better roll (the fungible canAddItem pre-gate passes
on stack top-up room while a signed instance needs a fresh slot;
runtime-confirmed via the crossing case of a slot-full bag holding a
partial stack of the zone material). Every signed unit now requires a
genuinely free slot, with an unsigned stack top-up fallback when none
exists, so the truncation contract wins over signing in that edge; the
draw order and the professions_gather golden are byte-identical. The
corpse focus-harvest path carries the same pre-existing hole (it was
the cited precedent) and is filed as #2139, deliberately not fixed
here because it sits outside the phase diff. QA also landed: the
crossing-case pin, the finder-only achievement-cue pin plus
quality-color source pins (the unpinned halves of the D1 contract and
acceptance criterion 5), and comment corrections (the gatherLine
catalog comment described the exact loot-family wording the divergence
pin forbids; the gathering.ts header still claimed no world nodes
exist; gatherRareEvent's spare fields named as Phase 15 forward
payload; corpseLootAvailability's harvestStateReliable documented as a
deliberately retained seam whose false arm stays pinned POSITIONALLY
in tests/corpse_loot_availability.test.ts and tests/interactions.test.ts,
which a name-only grep misses, an audit claim that dissolved exactly
there). Verified dismissals: finderName cannot smuggle the [[i:
item-link token (validCharNameShape forbids brackets), and all four
phase-emphasis probes bind. Deferred with reasons: the rare-event
windfall's per-instance loot-line/cue burst (consistent with the D1
cue-ownership decision, Phase 15 polish candidate), the zone-1 signed
starter instances design confirm (maintainer, see state.md), the
gatherEvent.* top-level catalog namespace (functional, moving it now
is overlay churn without user value), and the pre-existing unused
instanceOrigin import in tests/parity/scenarios.ts.

### Phase 5: The professions wheel window
- [ ] New window at deeds quality per DESIGN.md: view core (UI_PURE_CORES), painter, styles, i18n
- [ ] Ring visualization, per-craft skill bars, tier pips, title/majors/hobby, live perks
- [ ] Identity-view semantics preserved (role, ceiling, nudges, tutorial); next-unlock and switch-cost lines
- [ ] Progressive disclosure: simplified unattuned / pre-first-tier state
- [ ] Desktop + mobile responsive; screenshots captured for the PR
- [ ] Launchers (minimap or window row + keybind) consistent with existing windows

### Phase 6: Crafting window upgrades and celebrations
- [ ] Recipe rows show profession + required skill + skill-gain difficulty tint (#2037)
- [ ] Combo rows name their requirement; station-bound rows show a badge and disable reason
- [ ] Masterwork toast + zone-visible broadcast (Phase 4 soft-zone mechanism); tier-up toasts; maker's mark and masterwork in item tooltips
- [ ] Online inspect carries instance payloads (identity wire extended, parity pinned)
- [ ] Craft button never lies: same eligibility rule as the sim in both hosts

### Phase 7: The Guild letter and quest objectives
- [ ] Craft/gather quest objective types (minimal set for the letter quest)
- [ ] The Guild letter arrives via the mail system on trend detection; starts the first-attunement quest hook
- [ ] S3 scanner gap closed: `src/sim/quests/quest_commands.ts` in scan scope, guard test updated

### Phase 8: Stations and masters (sim and server)
- [ ] Station registry generalizes `requiresHubStation` to typed stations (forge, kitchens, apothecary, tannery, loom, toolworks); `CRAFTING_HUB_MIN_LEVEL` retired
- [ ] Master NPC records for the six deep crafts, spread across the three zone hubs (four archetype anchors in zone 1; tannery in Fenbridge; apothecary in Highwatch; assignment pinned)
- [ ] Automated placement-safety test: no profession NPC or station within aggro-plus-buffer of hostile spawns
- [ ] Mobile crafting station perk activates (bypasses the station gate; specialization-gated)

### Phase 9: Station presence and recipe training
- [ ] Stations render as world props; masters render and are interactable; minimap markers
- [ ] Skill-tier-gated recipe training at masters on the `acquireRecipe` gate, with the visible locked-row ladder; every existing recipe grandfathered known
- [ ] Master shops stocked (base tools, reagents); training fees are gold sinks
- [ ] Hands-vs-stations split live: field recipes craft anywhere, uncommon+ at stations

### Phase 10: Recipe ladders and materials content
- [ ] Tier ladders for all six deep crafts (common through rare at minimum) with material families
- [ ] Cloth sourcing: humanoid components + plant fiber; corpse component quest-item collision ended
- [ ] Economy invariant test pinned: no recipe vendors for more than its inputs
- [ ] Cross-tier composition; combat-worthy consumables at every cooking/alchemy tier; materialTierBonus wired; the perfect specimen
- [ ] Wiki content regenerated; recipe data feeds the guide

### Phase 11: Fishing joins the framework
- [ ] Fishing proficiency (additive, framework-integrated) while the minigame stays as-is
- [ ] Catch rarity ladder feeds cooking tiers; rare catch integrates (deed intact)

### Phase 12: Base tool tier gating
- [ ] Nodes carry tiers; tool tier + skill gate node and corpse-material access
- [ ] The 15 existing tools change outcomes; stale no-op test pin replaced
- [ ] Tool effects remain parked (explicitly out of scope)

### Phase 13: Enchanting reachable
- [ ] Disenchant + enchant-apply + salvage on IWorld, wire commands, bags context UI, both hosts
- [ ] Enchanting skill visible in the wheel window

### Phase 14: Attunement quests and nudges
- [ ] Acceptance lore quests at the masters for all four wave-one archetypes
- [ ] Repeatable-quest support; make-amends wired; cheap-first-switch costs
- [ ] Trend nudges (chat first, Guild letter voice); attunement summary explains everything before commit
- [ ] Work-order quests per master (cadence-capped) and one-shot-per-tier master mail
- [ ] Title celebration on attunement

### Phase 15: Deeds, tuning, and polish
- [ ] Universal profession deeds incl. titles + marquee renown on first attunement and first masterwork, the Specialist deed, and the rare-find deeds (plus the rare fish, verified)
- [ ] Economy tuning targets applied (#1301 fee/throttle, training fees, teach tiers, work orders, masterwork bounds); faucet-vs-sink review recorded
- [ ] Guide/wiki professions page rewritten; asset manifest final
- [ ] Whole-feature qa-checklist.md matrix green; packet teardown offered

## Notes

(append per-phase notes, deferrals, and surprises here as sessions complete)

2026-07-17 design-review amendments: a maintainer design review (the
response to the external Codex review) amended the packet between Phases 2
and 3. state.md records the rulings under "2026-07-17 design-review
amendments"; the owning phase and QA files, the cross-cutting docs, and the
asset manifest carry the updated deliverables (see the amendment PR's diff
for the full file list). The any-signed masterwork condition ships as its
own code change ahead of Phase 3, verified by the Phase 3 pre-flight. The
checklists above were updated in the same pass; unchecked items describe
the AMENDED deliverables.

Phase 2 (2026-07-17): phase-start commit 9a5ce7a93 (the Phase 1 QA merge,
the release/v0.27.0 head); code-final commit 90ba58f17 (the
professions_craft parity golden); the docs commit follows it, so the QA
session diffs 9a5ce7a93..branch-head. Implemented on the worktree branch
feature/professions-2-phase-02-masterwork. Validation: whole-repo tsc
clean; the six phase suites (204 tests), the new and reader suites (122),
the net/wire row (377), and tests/parity (174 passed, one pre-existing
env-gated skip) all green; the full gate passed every stage except the
known environmental armory browser failure (PR CI is the arbiter), with
typecheck and the env/server/client builds finished manually per the
established playbook. Reviews: six read-only reviewers (architecture,
cross-platform-sync, privacy-security, migration-safety, qa-checklist,
test-coverage-auditor), zero blocking and zero unresolved should-fix
findings; the archetype-ceiling-gates-masterwork semantic and the
chore-first commit order are deliberate and explained in the commit
bodies. Deferred and surfaced items live in the Phase 2 drift notes in
state.md: the rollback enchantability caveat for the release notes, the
two battlefield trickle questions, the guide prose deferral to Phases 6
and 15, and the standing instance-payload wire invariant.
